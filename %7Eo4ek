**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

9 years ago I was having, for the first time, access to PC which was connected 24/h to net. In a moment I become NET-dependent (to be honest -- I was spending much more time on IRCing and FTPing than studying :-). After short period I was having access to our faculty primary UnixWare server and from this time I'm persuade that for serious work the only suitable platform is Linux/Unix :-).

My first Linux distro wich I personaly installed was Slackware (first install -- 8 years ago, now I don't remember exactly the version from wich I started up :-). After I was using RH, MDK.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**
**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

In the January 2002 I was looking for some linux/unix distro which fulfil my needs (I was looking for something which is source based, with some cool pkg.sys., something where I can in some easy way change the configure/build parameters, etc....). My first idea was freebsd but before changing linux for unix I was looking at http://www.distrowatch.com where I found SGL -- and after installing it I was seeing that this is something for me :-)

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

For me the SMGL is the ideal distro for people which have some knowledge about linux and which "want the full power of Linux/PC". I use SMGL not only as desktop but also on 3 production machines (and in the 3 months we will build up an database cluster on which we will run SMGL :-)

So personally I'm very satisfied with SMGL and I really recommend this cool distro to everybody :> .

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I graduate at Zilina's Technical University -- Informatics department, my thesis was: "Object oriented compiler of SQL language".

I'm currently on the 3.year of my PhD study (my PhD. thesis is: Fulltext search in large text databases :-). In the same time I'm:

* teaching at the University (courses like: Linux/Aix administration, Object oriented programming in Pascal/C++/Delphi, Neural Networks)
* administering our faculty servers (3 SMGL, 3 RH, 2 MDK, 2 UnixWare (as co-admin :-)), 1 Aix boxes and also 5 Win2k "srv")
* working as Project manager for one little enterprise (15 people).

To tell something about my skills/career here is stripped cut && paste of last 2 accomplished projects from my CV:

{{{
 - "Fulltext/workflow document management system"
