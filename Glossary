=Glossary of terms=

Source Mage utilizes a magic and mythology metaphor for the names of many of our project components. Some of these are defined below.

==Core Terms and Components==

[[Sorcery]]

Source Mage's package management system component.

[[Spell]]

A collection of scripts, processed by Sorcery, to install a particular software package (similar to an RPM, ebuild, etc. for other distributions).

[[Grimoire]]

Generally, Source Mage's package collection component. More specifically, a collection of spells for a particular purpose. Currently we provide the following grimoires ourselves; others may provide more:

|= Grimoire =|= Description =|
| **stable** | a release cycle-controlled collection of spells that should be bug-free |
| **stable-rc** | a release cycle-controlled collection of spells that is the next stable version release candidate |
| **test** | a collection of spells that represents the bleeding edge; these versions compile for at least the developer that committed them, but may leave your system a smoldering ruin |
| **games** | a collection of spells to install games, game servers and clients, etc. |
| **z-rejected** | a collection of spells which are not included in the primary grimoires because of licensing or other issues. These are more or less supported, depending on individual interest and availability |
| **binary** | a collection of free (FSF-approved) software that are distributed in binary form, for example, binary versions of OpenOffice.org and Firefox |
