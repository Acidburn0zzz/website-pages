== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started playing with Linux in 1998 with RedHat 5.x. Since then I've used Debian and SuSE (both of which I think are excellent distributions by the way), but I haven't moved from Source Mage (or Sorcerer as it was then) since I discovered it. I don't intend to either!

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since 2002.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

It's a great distribution for learning about how Linux works. I also like having bang-up-to-date software all the time.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

World Domination of course.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I have a BSc in computer science and an MSc in games programming. I started programming with Visual Basic 4 through 6, moving to Java once I started university (what a relief!). I picked up bash and Perl skills while I was there. Since I became interested in graphics programming C++ has been my language of choice. I've also done quite a bit of work in C# and dabbled in PHP.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I started out on the Amstrad CPC. I've used RISC OS, Solaris and every Windows from v3. I prefer SMGL above all of them :-)

**Do you have any family?**

A sister.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

A Honda Civic. My dream car would be some kind of hydrogen-fuelled roadster. Sexy yet environmentally friendly!
