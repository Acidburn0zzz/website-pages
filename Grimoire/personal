It's possible to create your own [[Grimoire]] for local usage or public consumption.

All you have to do is described in 3 steps:

# create a directory with the same structure ({{{grimoire/section}}})
# add it to [[Sorcery]] config file with all grimoires defined ({{{/etc/sorcery/local/grimoire}}}) while incrementing an index
# mark it local with {{{scribe localize}}} (so [[Sorcery/Commands/Scribe|scribe]] won't try to update it on {{{scribe update}}})

For example:

{{{
# scribe index

Codex Listing
-------------

 [0] : stable : /var/lib/sorcery/codex/stable : 0.61-20
}}}

Let's create a new grimoire with a name "craft":

{{{
# mkdir /var/lib/sorcery/codex/craft
# cat /etc/sorcery/local/grimoire
GRIMOIRE_DIR[0]=/var/lib/sorcery/codex/stable
# echo "GRIMOIRE_DIR[1]=/var/lib/sorcery/codex/craft" >> /etc/sorcery/local/grimoire
}}}

**Note** the {{{GRIMOIRE_DIR[1]}}}.

Make sure it appears in the [[Codex]]:

{{{
# scribe index

Codex Listing
-------------

 [0] : stable : /var/lib/sorcery/codex/stable : 0.61-20
 [1] : craft : /var/lib/sorcery/codex/craft
}}}

Now we will copy some simple [[Spell]] (which doesn't use specific functions from FUNCTIONS file in grimoire's root directory, otherwise you need to copy/link these files from the existent grimoire):

{{{
# mkdir /var/lib/sorcery/codex/craft/utils
# cp -R /var/lib/sorcery/codex/stable/utils/acpid /var/lib/sorcery/codex/craft/utils/
}}}

With the next command we will swap the grimoires to rise "craft" priority:

{{{
# scribe swap stable craft
# scribe index

Codex Listing
-------------

 [0] : craft : /var/lib/sorcery/codex/craft
 [1] : stable : /var/lib/sorcery/codex/stable : 0.61-20
}}}

and reindex all spells in it:

{{{
# scribe reindex craft
}}}

**Note:** you need to do this every time you add/remove any spell to/from it.

Since now {{{cast acpid}}} will [[Sorcery/Commands/Cast|cast]] "acpid" from your new "craft" grimoire. You can modify the spell (i.e. change version and update checksum to downgrade or upgrade it), add or remove configure flags and so on. Take a look at our [[Spell/Writing Handbook|Spell Writing Handbook]] for more information.
