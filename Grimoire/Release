= Grimoire release process =

This page describes how [[Grimoire/stable|stable grimoire]] is updated regularly.

== Branching ==

**1.** On the 1st of each month, the grimoire version currently in the [[Grimoire/test|test]] (master) branch is branched to the next [[Grimoire/stable-rc|stable-rc]]:

* {{{git checkout -b stable-rc-$STABLE_RC_VERSION master}}}
* {{{sed -i 's/-test/-rc/' VERSION}}}
* {{{git commit -m "VERSION: $(cat VERSION)" VERSION}}}
* {{{git push origin stable-rc-$STABLE_RC_VERSION:refs/heads/stable-rc-$STABLE_RC_VERSION}}}

**2.** At the same time, test gets its {{{VERSION}}} incremented as well; normally this means bumping the minor version; major version updates are at the discretion of the Grimoire Lead:

* {{{git checkout master}}}
* {{{sed -i 's/$OLD_TEST_VERSION/$NEW_TEST_VERSION/' VERSION}}}
* {{{git commit -m "VERSION: $(cat VERSION)" VERSION}}}
* {{{git push origin master}}}

**3.** A new page is created for the new release by using [[Release/Template]] to make [[Grimoire/stable]]{{{/$STABLE_RC_VERSION}}}.

**4.** The release testing proceeds as described on the release page, with the following additions:

* The target release date is the 15th of the month.
* The {{{-rc}}} branch must be frozen for 72 hours before it can be released as stable. This means no new commits on this branch. Exceptions are security updates and any other commits which meet the criteria for an out of cycle stable update, since they are already in stable anyway.
* Regardless of any updates run prior to the freeze, during the freeze period those who are able should run {{{sorcery system-update}}} and/or full rebuilds using the stable-rc candidate and note any remaining or newly introduced gating bugs.

**5.** When the release is complete, the new stable is branched from stable-rc:

* {{{git checkout -b stable-$STABLE_RC_VERSION origin/stable-rc-$STABLE_RC_VERSION}}}
* {{{sed -i 's/-rc/-0/' VERSION}}}
* {{{git commit -m "VERSION: $(cat VERSION)" VERSION}}}
* {{{git push origin stable-$STABLE_RC_VERSION:refs/heads/stable-$STABLE_RC_VERSION}}}

**6.** A release tag and tarball are generated as described in [[#tarball|tarball update]].

**7.** After the release, any **fixed** bugs against this stable-rc or the previous stable need to be **closed**.

**8.** If the new release is not done when the 1st of the next month arrives, that branch is abandoned and a new {{{-rc}}} is created and the process starts over.

{{#tarball}}
== Tarball update ==

This section described how to update a grimoire tarball.

=== Pre-requisites ===

**1.** Get a local grimoire checkout to push updates from; this should usually be different from the one you do work in, because the branch it's on will change behind your back and will usually not even be a real branch.

**2.** Get the script at {{{distro.sourcemage.org:/usr/local/sbin/update-grimoire}}} and edit the top section with your local information (key ids, paths, etc.). If you are not using devel [[Sorcery]], be sure you have the latest {{{/usr/local/sbin/generate-grimoire-version-cache}}} in the same location as your {{{update-grimoire}}} script.

**Note:** currently the stable key is shared (key ID **0xB6632F2E**), while stable-rc uses per-developer keys found in the {{{grimoire-stable-rc}}} keyring.

=== Doing an update ===

**1.** Verify the stable or stable-rc version at the top of the local {{{update-grimoire}}} script is current.

--- //if updating stable only// ---

**2.** In your normal edit grimoire:
* {{{git checkout stable-$STABLE_VERSION}}}
* Increment the "release" number in {{{VERSION}}} (the part after the {{{-}}})
* {{{git commit -m "VERSION: $(cat VERSION)" VERSION}}}
* {{{git tag -m "stable-$(cat VERSION)" -u $STABLE_KEYID "stable-$(cat VERSION)"}}}
* {{{git push -v --tags ssh://scm.sourcemage.org/smgl/grimoire stable-$STABLE_VERSION:stable-$STABLE_VERSION}}}

--- //end if updating stable only// ---

**3.** {{{update-grimoire $GRIMOIRE}}}

**4.** Follow the prompts.

The newly uploaded tarball will show up on [[http://master.download.sourcemage.org]] at around 30 minutes past every 3 hours, US Central Time //(12:30, 3:30, 6:30, etc.)//. [[Mirrors]] will update from there on their own schedules.
