= Grimoire build API =

A file named {{{API_VERSION}}} may exist at the [[Grimoire|grimoire]] level and/or the section level. In this file one variable may be defined: {{{BUILD_API}}}.

This variable may be given the values '1' or '2'. To denote which build api the grimoire or section uses.

In addition {{{BUILD_API}}} may also be defined in a [[Spell|spell]]'s [[Spell/Files/DETAILS|DETAILS]] file.

{{{API_VERSION}}} file must have the executable bit set (so a {{{test -x}}} passes).

The files are sourced in the following order:

# $GRIMOIRE/API_VERSION
# $SECTION/API_VERSION
# $SPELL/DETAILS

Thus the section level will override the grimoire level and the spell level will override the section and grimoire levels.

If the {{{BUILD_API}}} variable is not defined the behavior defaults to it being defined as '2'.

A quick rundown of what '1' and '2' mean:

Build API v1:

[[Spell/Files/PRE_BUILD|PRE_BUILD]] -> [[Spell/Files/BUILD|BUILD]] -> [[Spell/Files/POST_BUILD|POST_BUILD]] -> [[Spell/Files/POST_INSTALL|POST_INSTALL]] -> [[Spell/Files/TRIGGERS|TRIGGERS]]

Build API v2:

[[Spell/Files/PRE_BUILD|PRE_BUILD]] -> [[Spell/Files/BUILD|BUILD]] -> [[Spell/Files/PRE_INSTALL|PRE_INSTALL]] -> [[Spell/Files/INSTALL|INSTALL]] -> [[Spell/Files/POST_INSTALL|POST_INSTALL]] -> [[Spell/Files/FINAL|FINAL]] -> [[Spell/Files/TRIGGERS|TRIGGERS]]
