= Z-rejected grimoire =

The z-rejected grimoire "evolved" from the z-rejected section on the main grimoires ([[Grimoire/test|test]], [[Grimoire/stable|stable]]).

It is intended for those spells that are not GPL (or equivalent). Since the creation of the [[Grimoire/games|games]] grimoire, games that fit in these categories will not be included here, but in the z-rejected section in the games grimoire.
