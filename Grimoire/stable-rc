= Stable-rc grimoire =

This grimoire is the release candidate for the next stable. This means that it should be quite stable, but is still undergoing some testing before it's declared stable.

When a new stable grimoire gets released, the current [[Grimoire/test|test]] becomes [[Grimoire/stable-rc|stable-rc]]. Then that grimoire is tested and enhanced continuously until the next stable release.
