| shadow | sobukus | X | X | X (sandalle) | #13505 is gating until the two/three requested commits are integrated, broken default group behaviour of useradd remains - an upstream bug that has to be fixed some time (I disagree that this should be gating; it's been around forever, and I'm not willing to approve this kind of integration to something this critical right before the release. Let it soak in test first. --emrys); OK, then I'll make my sign-off after the degating --- sobukus |
