== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started using Linux in 2000, to try an alternative to Windows, that was free, documented, and with a good community.

I'm happy with it since!

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I've been using SMGL since late 2008.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I was looking for a source linux distribution, and after testing different ones, I elected SMGL; what I like in Source Mage is its flexibility, its package installation behaviour, and all other features that makes SMGL!

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I think that SMGL is constantly evolving, keeping in mind its first goals, it will grow more and more robust.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I am currently a IT student (I think that summarize most of what I can do, and that's not ironic !), I can design applications, code in most current languages (others is only a matter of time), setting up networks etc...

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Come to see what's there, enjoy it, adopt it, and give a hand ! :-D

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Not much.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Humm, well, I don't frankly understand the question. Of course vi(m).

**KDE or GNOME?**

I'm not really into big desktop environments, I've been using fluxbox for a time, I now rather use wmii.

**BSD or GPL?**

I would say that depends on the type of project, I like opensource, BSD is more free, GPL is safe... I don't really care for now.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

You won't have a date.

**What other hobbies?**

Well, I like birds and sun...

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Bahh, I move by public transport.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

That will come.
