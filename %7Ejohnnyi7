== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started using Linux in February 2002 because I was interested in how it worked and how open source in general worked.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since February 2002.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I had begun using Mandrake, but within a day or two I realized that I wasn't really in control of everything, that many decisions had already been made by the distro that I didn't really understand. I then heard about source-based distros and Sorcerer in particular. I downloaded the iso, got it burned, installed it and immediately liked what I saw.

My background in tech had started with a sales job for a software developer/reseller/hardware reseller in Fresno, CA. We were using CP/M and TurboDOS operating systems on Kaypros and IMS brand systems. IMS was an S100 bus type system that used TurboDOS. I learned to do most things for myself, became an installer, trainer and ultimately a consultant. The company evolved to Novell Netware and after rewriting all their software in Delphi, went to Win2000/SQLServer 2000.

My personal migration of OS's went to OS/2, Win98, Win2000 and then Linux.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I enjoy how it operates now. I don't want it to become the Linux of the masses. I want it to grow, but within its evisioned niche.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

My education came after my career. I started as a teacher of Transcendental Meditation, then did various jobs for a few years, then began selling audio systems until, one day, I had the realization that I needed to sell something that didn't require lying as part of the job description. After some thought, I realized that I had to choose a product/service that was inherently complex and therefore "hard" to sell. I chose computers because, though I knew nothing about them, I figured that very few sales types could really do it.

I've been in tech since that revelation in 1982 until I decided to return to school in the Fall of 2003. I've gotten a BA in Management in 2005 and will receive my MBA in July of 2006. Currently I'm preparing for the Certified Management Accountant test.

After I graduate, my wife and I will be moving to California.

Skills?! We don't need no stinking skills? Actually, I've got a private pilot's license, can write some SQL queries, can design databases, know accounting, quite good with Excel, have some html and am learning how to work with spells!

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

I really like how civil and helpful the community is and want it to stay that way.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

As a project? Only Source Mage in open source. Commercially, I worked for or was a dealer for Argos Software in Fresno, CA for over 20 years. I helped in the area of requirement gathering and spec writing for their vertical market ERP system.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Neither. My favorite editor was EditPlus on Windows, but haven't found one like it for linux. I haven't looked recently, so I use nano with [[~ruskie|ruskie]]'s highlighting for now.

**KDE or GNOME?**

e17. I tried gnome first, then kde, then xfce4, and finally e17. The last two have been the best.

**BSD or GPL?**

I like the notions that Richard Stallman and Eric S. Raymond promote. Having said that, I will use whatever software works.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Just my wife and I. I have sisters and parents in Sacramento along with hundreds of more distant relations in California.

**What other hobbies?**

I read, play accoustic and electric guitar, fly planes, into meditation, high-end audio/home theater, birding, riding my motorcycle, photography and travel.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I ride my motorcycle, a 1983 Honda Nighthawk CB650SC, and we have a 1992 Honda Accord. We would love to get a hybred/fuel cell/hydrogen powered vechicle when we can afford it. I'd love to own an airplane, if cost were no obsticle a Cirrus SR202, and I want a Yamaha FRJ1300.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

Don't currently have a digital picture, but will put one up as soon as I do...
