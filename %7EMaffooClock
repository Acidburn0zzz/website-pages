**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I think I purchased a box containing RedHat Linux 5.5 back in 1998 -- back before it used a GUI for installation. That was also before I knew I could have downloaded it for free, but I had dial-up then, so I really didn't have a choice anyhow.

I don't remember what made me want to try it. Heck, I don't even know how I heard that there was something beside Windows! But I had hell getting it to work. Partitioning was cryptic to me then, but I got it working after a few days. I then compiled my own kernel. Kernel 2.2, I think it was -- I remember it being 13MB in size, which took all afternoon to download.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I was introduced to SMGL by David Kowis who saw me setting up RedHat one day.  "Hey, you should check out Source Mage -- it looks like a pretty slick distro..."  That was back in 2002, maybe 2003 -- we were both in the Air Force and lived next door to each other.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

With RedHat, and even Mandrake, all kinds of garbage was installed on my machine. Even if I opted to install the development packages (in order to compile stuff), everything was built for generic i386 hardware. But when I learned that I could build a Linux box that had only what I wanted/needed and it would all be optimized for my hardware -- wow! After the first couple of rounds of building SMGL boxes, I became hooked.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I never really thought of it. I guess I just figured SMGL would always be there...

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I started building computers at home when I was 17. I joined the Air Force and got a job on the A-3 Sentry AWACS, but could not fly, so I had to pick another job. I spent three years in Air Force IT, and then got out early to start work with General Dynamics IT. I jumped ship to Lockheed Martin IT after a while and worked on intelligence training systems, but we lost the contract last year.

Now I work as a programmer for [[http://www.ener-tel.com/|Ener-Tel Services]], a local business who offers building automation solutions. I write programs which control simple rooftop heating and A/C units as well as complex chiller and boiler systems and all related pumps, valves, etcetera. Pretty cool job.

I don't have any degrees (but medical school is in my future). I have a few useless certifications, but they do nothing for me, only for my employers.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Well, if they are already using SMGL, do I need to say anything?

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Worked on as in "participated in development"?  None -- SMGL is my first real project involvement.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vi

**KDE or GNOME?**

KDE

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

I share an apartment with three cats. They let me stay as long as their bowls are full and their backs are scratched. It's a system that works for all of us.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I drive a 2005 Mazda 3s. It's not the fanciest ride, but it was something I liked, and I finally have one. I don't have a dream car -- pretty much I only care about what's neat and affordable at the time.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**
