**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Got my first PC 1996 or something so the first thing I did on dos was to run all .com .exe and .bat files. Used dos and win3.11 for a year or so then switched to win95. I was getting more and more annoyed by M$ and winblowz. Hmm.. so when I was in first year of highschool I think that was 1998 a new classmate told me about it and I was hooked(yup he only told me about it I never saw it before)... I guess it was all the bluescreens and such that finally got to me...

I started with RedHat(it had the redneck language option in thoose days) and then Caldera, Mandrake, Slackware, FreeBSD, Slackware and now smgl(also various other distros, Debian among others) but with most I quit while in install stage...

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Well should be a bit over a year now... I first found about a week (that would be July 2003) after I got back my inet this time on cable (I was cold turkey for 2 years due to high phone bills) I found about freenode and went there and did a list and I find this channel named #sourcemage (I first read it sourceforge (so I thought it was sf support chan)) but then I saw that it was a distro... not a big disappointment but I did try it out... on a k6-2 450@500 it was phun I had alot of problems compiling stuff since I had a lot of overheating so I decided to ditch it for now but I liked the simplicity and could never forget it. After a month I tried freebsd but it wasn't me, then I spent the next 6 months playing counterstrike and then switched to a linux only system(slackware(still my fav binary distro)) and then I started thinking about sourcemage again(got a sys upgrade somewhere in between those 6 months) I went for it removed everything and did a pure sourcemage only install...(I was in heaven) stuff that wouldn't compile did. I did try getting sorcery working on slack(with some success I might add) but it just wasn't the same....(a bit long and mixed up but I think you get the picture)

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

The from sources build system and it's simplicity....

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I guess that would be the dominant distro...

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Edu: CS highschool and now opting for a CS college(if I can scrape the cash) \\ Skills: hmm that would be getting to crash windows in the shortest time possible playing with a huge amount of OSes(my max install of os-es on a 20gb disk was 6 or so) taking things apart(and not knowing how to put them together again(if it's not a computer))

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Stay true to the source and it will stay true to you

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

OS/2 Warp 4, QNX, BeOS, all Windows(from 3.11 up), FreeBSD, and some other experimental OSes...

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Vim though in a pinch I can use vi though am much more likely to use sed :-)

**KDE or GNOME?**

FVWM

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL but I like both...

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Hmmmm... well 2 female cousins, one male cousin, 2 aunts(both divorced), 2 uncles(both divorced), mom and a cheapskake dad who doesn't pay(never even saw him)

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Hmmm that would be a state-of-the art AMD64... erm... ohh a car... erm none and a car I would build myself(a cross between a hummer and some sport cars and a volvo)
