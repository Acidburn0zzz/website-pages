**Which editor do I like:**

vim. vim is an IDE, right?

**Which window manager do I like:**

enlightenment 17 -- best window manager for someone with a laptop. I can't do without all the monitors on the button bar, and it's lighter than most other window managers.

The Tectra is one of Toshiba's business-style laptops. I got it new about September of 2004.

I've had Source Mage working on my laptop since the day I got it. \\ I've had full support for all of the hardware including wireless since about late November 2004.

I've also had really good luck at compile times with Source Mage (no distcc nor ccache):

| time cast glibc (which included triggers of apr apr-util and util-linux) | 20m39s |
| time cast mozilla | 42m53s |
| time cast gtk+2 | 7m22s |
