I really can't remember. Probably back in 2000 or 2001 with Slackware.

I installed SGL in January 2002 and went through the split and fork. I have enjoyed watching SMGL grow and improve so much along the way.

Having more control over what was installed and a desire to learn more about the workings of Linux.

Great. Need to keep the push on to have an updated grimoire that works all the time.
