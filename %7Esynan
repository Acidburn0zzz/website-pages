== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Back in 1999, mostly cause I was curious.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Um.. well, for 6 months now I guess. Not long :-)

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

The name, the fact that it was source based and a cool way of doing stuff in it.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

That's a hard one. If we get more people that'll do maintainance work we could grow very fast to a more popular distro.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Well, I am working at a computer hardware/software retail store as a salesman. I've been studying english and IT to be a professor, but haven't the time/will lately due to my work hours which can be unpredictable. My skills? heh.. well, besides general system maintainance, I do some coding in php and python. That's about it.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Yeah, tell everyone you know about how cool smgl is :-)

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Well, I've coded some stuff here and there, and have a sf.net project called [[http://freecode.com/projects/amaroc|amaroc]]. It's a ncurses frontend for amarok to ease control over network.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Hm.. nano? :-D

**KDE or GNOME?**

If I have to choose, it'd be KDE.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL. Definitely. No m$ will ever include my code into their crappy OS and make money out of it.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Well, besides my mother and my grandmother, no.

**What other hobbies?**

I like visiting new places, camping and such. Just like to get on a train and stop anywhere I haven't been.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I don't drive, altho I have a dream car. Opel Kadett C. Old but beautiful.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

Will do it some time later ;-)
