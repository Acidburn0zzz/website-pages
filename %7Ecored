**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I was working in this big programming company, the sysadmin of it told me that he will change the entire system platform to a new and better one, its name was Linux, so I decided to take a look, I found the Red Hat 5.0 cd on a desk, I tried to install that version on my work desktop, but that was all only a try, then I get tired of such things with an MS* background I always restart the machine to get things done even in my old DOS days. Then I quit that job and get a lot of free time so I decided to give Linux a chance, I went to my favorite computer store and got the Red Hat 6.2 CD, after reading the entire manual I figured out how to install and make some move in the system, two months later I hated Red Hat, I switched to Slackware; then a year later I installed Debian on my 386 machine and I let Slackware be on my desktop box.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Like 2 months or so.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

Well I found the LFS-HOWTO on linuxdoc and I made my own distro at that point, I used checkinstall and pkgutils from Slackware for my packages managment, after the hard drive crashes I was looking for a fast installation of a source based distro so I deciced to give it a try to gentoo; at first glance it was wonderful but when I got my feet wet with portage I began to dislike it, then I went to distrowatch and found a good resource for a source base distro, I saw on the ranking list the next Source base distro -- at the moment was SMGL, and here I am.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

This is a great distro with a great community and that is the heart of the open source movement, and the package system is getting better and better, soon will be a Source Mage user everywhere.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I have a Technical degree in Computers, and that's all. \\ I think I'm a good cooker too.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Keep using SMGL

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

MS-DOS 6.22, Windows 9x, Window NT*, FreeBSD, GNU/Linux distros (Debian, Slackware, Red Hat, CRUX, Arch)

**KDE or GNOME?**

**Do you have any family?**
