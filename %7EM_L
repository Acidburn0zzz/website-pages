== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started linux with 0.9/1.3 kernel series, on some old Yggdrasil/Slackware distributions, because I was attracted by this non-polished, do it yourself, VGA16/X11+fvwm style OS. Ages ago, I wanted to learn C, TCP/IP and OS architecture. \\ So I bought Unix book (with as far as I remember a free 0.96b linux kernel based distribution). I takes hours to have a 320x200x16 X11, with PSTN PPP connection up, but damn it was great !

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Ahem... it was SGL at this time, I started using S*GL by the end of 2001 I guess.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

SMGL is using bash for its core tools. This is easy to read, I like it. It is (it was) a small distribution that fit precisely my hardware with its architecture optimizations. Plus, there is no dumb wizard assistant that popup on the bottom left corner of the screen every time I move the mouse.

Then, I was using debian for a long time and I got a timeout waiting for woody :-( I was about to switch to NetBSD for philosophical reasons, then I found SMGL :-)

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

SMGL is and will be adressed to power users.

It may be propagated to more people if it gets easyer to setup, but SMGL will never be a Zindozs-like distribution.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

My girlfriend an I live in France, close to Paris but I was born in south of France (near to the Mediteranean sea).

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Source Mage is like Pepsi: It's linux better than linux ;-)

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Plenty... but I prefer linux anyway.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

CTRL+X^F emacs

**KDE or GNOME?**

KDE

**BSD or GPL?**

Both. Even proprietary licensing is good sometimes.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

I'm living in Paris, my family is living in south of France...

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

A Daewoo Nubira 2.0 CDX. This is my first Korean car, I like it.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**
