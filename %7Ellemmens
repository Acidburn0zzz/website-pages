== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started using linux in somewhere in '93 or so (kernel 0.9x, I think) using  a slackware distribution I picked up at a sale somewhere. Never looked back.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

In feb 2002, just before the big bang.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

The fact that it was completely source based and that the package manager was very intuitive and bashable.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

A great one of course :-). But realistically, we will probably stay out of mainstream. And that is a good thing. Distributions that get too large tend to be less fun.

The package manager by itself might go a long way on other OS'es though. I'd personally _love_ to have it on Solaris, AIX and HP.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I started programming in high school in '78 as extra-curricular activity, on a Commodore VIC 20 or PET. My first computer was a commodore 64.

I studied physics at the University of Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Did some theoretical work (Bose-Einstein condensation) and some work in the field of computer speech interpretation and graduated on the subject of psycho-acoustics. Useless but fun.

Started working in '90 as an application designer/programmer, later switched to pre-sales and later again to general troubleshooter doing bug fixing, interim system management and small projects.

I now work full time as unix systems manager for Oracle in the EMEA.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Thanks for trusting us. Keep sending them spells and may the source be with you.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Virtually anything that ends with an X and runs {{{ls}}}. And even some that don't ;-)

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vim !!!!

**KDE or GNOME?**

KDE

**BSD or GPL?**

I really don't care one way or an other. Freedom is also the freedom to choose that which is the most appropriate for the job. I'm very much an opportunist that way. Don't bugger me about copyrights and I won't bother you. Everything I write outside the office doors is completely free.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Yep. This year is the 11th anniversary of my marriage and I've got a daughter (9) and a son (6).

**What other hobbies?**

I like reading Fantasy & SF, movies and I'm a halfway decent cook. I'm also totally hooked on programming.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Renault Laguna wagon. It sucks. Don't ever buy one. I really don't have a dream car as long as it's big enough for all the junk we take to and back from holidays and keeps running. Though I'd like to own a Morgan one day when I'm old and gray enough :-)
