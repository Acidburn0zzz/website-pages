== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

My first Linux distro was Redhat 5.something. Must have been 1998 or 1999. \\ I wanted to see what that "Linux" is and if it is as good as some friends were trying to tell me.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Not sure about that. Maybe since 2002 ?

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I tested quite a few distros and their software package dependencies were driving me nuts. \\ So I wanted to have more control about what is getting installed.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

I used mc or nano most of the time. But I am getting used to vim lately.

**KDE or GNOME?**

I like GNOME for a long time, but switched to xfce4 when GNOME started to change in a way I didn't like.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL is what I prefer.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

One brother.

**What other hobbies?**

Sports -- jogging, martial arts, ...

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I own no car, don't want to, don't like them. \\ I like motorcycles (Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R is my favorite one)
