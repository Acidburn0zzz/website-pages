castfs is a [[http://fuse.sourceforge.net/|fuse filesystem]] written in C and is used for capturing filesystem calls for your root filesystem and staging any modifications or additions to the root filesystem.

The main purpose for this filesystem is to be able to invoke the filesystem in the Source Mage package manager ([[Sorcery]]) to install packages without blowing over files in your main system. However, there maybe other uses in the future.
