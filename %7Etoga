== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Really it was with minix in the mid 80's. I started using Linux in the fall of 1997 with a RedHat distribution, 5.2 I think.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since the split from Sorcerer, it was a smooth transition.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I came along with the split from Sorcerer. The prospect of being able to maintain GNU/LINUX in a more controlable manner compared to other methods like RPM really appealed to me.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I think 10 things will allow SMGL to become an excellent distribution.

01. Distributed compiling, used by sysadmins to create tailored systems for users. \\
02. The people involved with SMGL constantly making it better. \\
03. Higher net access speeds will allow net installs of SMGL. \\
04. (Thinking about it) \\
10. UML -- User-mode Linux. To create and test new systems/kernels without affecting production systems.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

This is it.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Neither, but many, depends on the job.

**KDE or GNOME?**

Neither, remember I'm the Windowmanagers guru.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Wife, daughter and a dog.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

1994 Mustang (31K Miles) and 1989 Honda Civic.
