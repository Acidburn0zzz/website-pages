== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I first used Linux in about 1999-2000, Mandrake 7.2 IIRC from the APC Linux Pocketbook 3rd edition, I installed it on a Compaq Presario something or other, a PI 133 with no expansion slots, 16Mb of and the CPU soldered to the MB <g>, install was pretty easy with the GNOME desktop installed by default, which unfortunately was a bit much for the old box which preformed like a slug.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I alternated between Windows and various Linux distros (Mandrake, Turbo & Red Hat) for the next couple of months until I got some money together and upgraded to a Celery 700 with 128Mb of Ram and was absolutely amazed by the difference this made to GNOME, and made Linux my sole OS.

I moved to Debian, and then a LFS system which I ran for about 9 months but really lacked the time required to maintain it in good working order and was consider going back to Debian when I came across the now defunct Sorcery/GNU Linux which I installed in Feb 2002 <g> just in time for Kyle to pull the plug.

I think that answers the first two questions.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

What peaked my interest in SMGL ?
Well coming from running a LFS system but lacking the time to do all the updates & maintenance such a beast needs I was looking for something else and here it was.

I loved the simple packaging system, I wrote my first spell (urlview) within about 2 hours of completing the install, SMGL is what I've been looking for in an OS, easy packaging and maintenance of apps, clean installs & uninstalls and the ability to add or customize packages to my need.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

For the future I see SMGL becoming a large community, AKA Debian Linux, I believe anyone you tries SMGL will love it, nothing that come close to the ease of use and maintenance that SMGL allows.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

About ME!!

Well I'm 27, I work as a instrumental music teacher with mostly primary school age kids but a number of older and more advanced pupils as well.

In the past I've worked as an Accordionist and a Youth Worker but teaching is what I love best and hope to be staying at it for a while.

No real computer training just a lot of hands on experience, which is the best way to learn IMHO.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

To SMGL users,

Enjoy, have fun, contribute. \\ SMGL exists because of a community of users each given a little to the distro, even bug reports are welcomed with open arms.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

First box was a TRS80 Model II, taught myself BASIC on this wonderful box, It's still running at my my grand parents place too. Then a lot of DOS (DR-DOS mostly) I've used Acorns and old Macs and was stuck in windows for about 2 years.

But SMGL is my first active role in a big development.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vi AND Emacs <g>

vi for bash scripts or C \\ Emacs for LaTeX and TeX projects

**KDE or GNOME?**

Neither. I'm a Fvwm man all the way, I've fooled around with both but always come home to Fvwm.

**BSD or GPL?**

I'd use the GPL license my self but I've nothing against BSD people, it's really a matter of personal choice.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Not married and no kids.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I don't drive as I've got incredibly poor vision, when I do need to get around I ride a bike averaging about 30 kilometers a day ATM, planning on doing some overnight touring rides during the xmas break.

If I did though I'd probably own a VW something or other as I've always liked the way they looked.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

I'm the one with the Accordion, the Soprano & Harpist is the wonderful Cathie Henderson.
