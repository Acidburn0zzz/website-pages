**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started in September 1998 and I'm not sure what my reason was.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I'll figure that out when I get the laptop back.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I've been through some sessions of manually upgrading software on Red Hat and Mandrake. Trying to figure out what libraries to upgrade is a nightmare. It's easier to recompile the program with the existing libraries. When I tried out SourceMage, it cast its spell on me and I was fascinated.
