**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I think I started using Linux in october 2003, by a heavy day :-D. I don't know why did I start using Linux, maybe because "Blue" is not my favourite color and too many blue screens -- it's not good for health. The first time was with Mandrake 9.0 on the laboratory of my high school. And the first thing I loved in a Linux System was [[http://tuxracer.sourceforge.net/images/screenshots/console_1.jpg|this]]. After this I discovered all the Free Software and Open Source Movement. And I just love it for its ideas. Today it's my first passion.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I use Source Mage since July 2004 ... and it changed my "Computing" life. I met [[~Unet|Unet]] in Febuary 2004 during a training course (I don't know if it's the good word) with the [[http://eole.orion.education.fr|Eole Team]]. In July I went back to Eole Project for my first computing job. I was looking for a good distribution to get more experience with Linux. Unet introduced myself to Source Mage and I simply fall in love with this distribution. After this I worked 15 days to get a clean system on my computer, and since these days I continue with Source Mage on my main computer.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I think it's community. On the first days a lot of people on IRC channels helped me. After that it's the Source Compiling concept and the last -- all the things you can learn on installing SMGL.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I don't know, but for me, many years of contribution and promotion of SMGL.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Ho you ask me a lot ... When I was a child I saw a black screen with green letters on a TV show since this day I'm bewitched by computing.

I started my Education by "accountancy", very fast I moved to computing studies. Last Year I had my degree and I work for a Computing company since 2005.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Use Use and Use more !!! Call all your friends and USE Source Mage GNU/Linux !! That's a great experience.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I work with these OS:
* M$ Windows,
* Sun Solaris,
* IBM AiX,
* HP HP-UX

I worked on:
* Eole Project
* OCS Inventory (I work on the AiX agent but I think my work fell into a big hole)
* Ensorcel (Maybe one day I'll finish this)

I work for:
* [[http://www.else-projects.org|Else Projects]] (With friends we create the Else Team)
* SOREDI 

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Definitely **VIM**. I don't need an other Operation system, an editor is enough.

**KDE or GNOME?**

Enlightenment DR17, what else ?

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL, I think free software have to stay Free.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Yes I have a very big family,

* Dad and his 8 brothers and sisters, 36 cousins and 16 little cousins,
* Mom and her 8 brothers and sisters, 15 cousins and 7 little cousins,
* My little Sister.
* My girlfriend "Claire"
* My Daughter "Ana√©"

**What other hobbies?**

After this, sometimes, I make some http://picasaweb.google.com/caseiro.philippe.

I have Exotic Birds.

I paint miniatures of wargames.

I read a lot of fantasy and SF and other books.

I love travelling and go back to my country (Portugal).

I love culture, politics, science, ecology, I'm very interested by this world.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I drive a Seat Leon. I don't dream of cars, it's not very important for me but If I had to choose one ... I think the Shelby GT500 is a good choice. I love old american Cars.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

Brave ... brave ... no I'm not
