**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started using Linux back in 1995. A friend of mine showed me that there was a new OS for free (free!!!) that ran like Unix. Being a Unix buff, I immediately started the process of getting it installed. Many MANY hours later I finally had a working version of Linux installed on my computer. I have been happily keeping up to date on it ever since.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since around November of 2001.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

The fact that it was a source-based distribution of Linux. I had been toying with LFS (Linux From Scratch) for almost 2 months prior to that, in an endeavor to learn more about how all the various parts of Linux interact with one another. The bonus part was definitely sorcery. It helped wean me off of apt (which I was hooked to from having been a debian user..) by providing me with simple command to fetch and install packages and their dependencies.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I see it becoming a powerhouse distribution once everything is settled down, and we all start getting really serious about the distribution. I think 1.0 should bring a sobering effect on the community, once we have reached that major milestone. Once we have a 1.0 version out we should start seeing more users and more developers joining in, since then the distribution will have achieved "gold" status.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Education: \\
* High School Diploma from Guam Community College
* 3 days of college. :-)
* Various industry certifications, not to be listed for fear of being laughed out of the distro ;-)

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Coffee good! :-) \\ But seriously. This distribution is in its infancy when compared to other distributions out there. I doubt we could be compared to a more major Linux distribution like Debian or (ugh) RedHat. In time, however, this will come to pass. All I can ask is that you all hang in there in the meantime. With enough users, and enough contributions from the community, we will reach their status in no time.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Nexgen Audica, a multimedia app for Windows. \\ NexEncode, an MP3 encoder.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Yes.

**KDE or GNOME?**

Is there a difference? I prefer Gnome but it runs all that KDE does....and vice versa.

**BSD or GPL?**

The BSD License provides the author with more control over his/her own creation. But only by having room to move can an idea multiply and evolve. The GPL provides such room. Given room, and adequate exposure, any given app can become the Next Big Thing(tm). Ideas to me are biological entities. They grow and multiply, much like viruses. If we give a singular idea enough room and interaction, we can creates something truly splendid with it. So I guess that's a long way of saying that I wholeheartedly am for the GPL.

In order for new ideas to be created, old ones must be sacrificed to the altar of Thought.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Yes. Some sisters, no brothers.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Currently I drive a 1972 VW Super Beetle. \\ My dream car is a Nissan Skyline GTR, with all the trimmings.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

Attached :-)   ..to be added
