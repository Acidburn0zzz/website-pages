== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Oups... Somewhen in 1998, with a redhat. Not convinced at this time. I used a dual boot with a suse 2 years ago, for development. 1 year ago, I deleted suse and win, and took mandrake. And since february, I run only SMGL.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

February 2002.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

Compile everything to suit my needs. The more I think about it, the more I find it extraordinary. Oh, and I run a 450Mhz celeron with 512Mb RAM, just to be said.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

A great one.

There are, imho, two very differences with other distros:
* The size of our distro isn't limited, it is really easier to add a software to smgl than to mandrake or debian on the cdrom. The consequences are great : GNU/Linux is about choice, and freedom. We have the ability to bring more choice to users, even the choice to install binary-only package. There are in SMGL some games you won't see anywhere else, like adonthell, simply because size is limited in a classical distro...
* We, not only as maintainers, but as users too, dialog with the authors of softwares, because we have the "right" problems. Not those which are already solved, but those which need to be solved. Because of that, SMGL will mathematically be fast renowned. As we are a perfect development environment, everything is for the best in the best possible world...

These reasons are theoretic, and for the future, but you asked me what I thought personally ;-)

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

French. The main difference with the others ;-) \\ Just kidding.

24 years, never anymore student in 1 month, but software engineer (very proud of it).
Have and will travel to work in Europe. Very few skills, only a little perl to earn money, and I'm horrible to bash. I learn, but not as quick as I should.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Just submit games spells ;-)

Always ready to help if you have a problem and it's in the range of my very limited experience.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Hu ? Nothing ?

As developer, nothing noticeable.

As user... The list is too long !! Mainly windows from 1997 to 1999, mainly linux after.

I use at work a redhat, and suse on IBM mainframes.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Definitely vi.

Is it possible to have vi as editor in kmail? \\ I'll check it.

**KDE or GNOME?**

KDE.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL. Very very important to understand the money problem behind, and the freedom problem too.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

My parents, and a brother. Heart to take, if a lady is interested in.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Do not drive. Maybe in a month. The last mercedes as dream car, with an extraordinary sound system, and chairs comfortable enough to make love in it rather to come back to home.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

Oups! Do not have a digitalised recent photograph. So sorry! \\ Will try to have one, promised.
