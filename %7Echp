== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Late 2004 or early 2005. I took part in the National Olympiad in Informatics contest and started to know about Linux. I tried Red Hat 9 out of curiosity, and was intrigued by Linux' flexible development environment. From then on, I learned all kinds of tools in Linux, tried various distributions and BSDs and there is only Source Mage on my computer now.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since April 2009.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I've always been interested in LFS. I don't like Gentoo's portage. It took me some time (2 years?) to find this fascinating distribution and community!

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I don't even see the future for myself :-P. I expect a slowly growing user number and people who use it will like it.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I'm currently a BE student majoring in CS and I'm a fast learner ;-).

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

If you are a to-be SM user: Source Mage is said to be the most user-friendly source-based distribution. It really is. And sorcery is written in bash! If you are a serious Linux user/developer and you get stuck installing customized packages constantly, I think Source Mage is an excellent choice for you. \\ If you are an SM user: the community is a treasury and a family!

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I contributed some patches, but this is the first project that I have write access to.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Both.

**KDE or GNOME?**

None.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL for my code, but BSD is not annoying.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Mom and Dad.

**What other hobbies?**

Chinese traditional calligraphy, Paleography, Tennis, Swimming, etc.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

No car. No dream car.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

No recent photograph...
