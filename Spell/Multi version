= Multi version spells =

There are cases where a spell writer wants to allow a choice of version in a [[Spell|spell]]. Most of the times this is about pulling the current version from a source code management system like CVS, Subversion or Git. There are other cases where an upstream project releases "stable" and "development" versions.

First rule for allowing such a version choice is that all dependencies of the spell need to work with all versions, otherwise the spell should be split.

The version choice is done in [[Spell/Files/PREPARE|PREPARE]] using the usual {{{config_query*}}} functions. If there are more than two different versions to choose from, this should be done using {{{config_query_list}}}, always defaulting to the version upstream recommends as "stable":

{{{
config_query_list FVWM_RELEASE "Which release would you like to build?" stable unstable cvs
}}}

If there are only two versions, an alternative would be to do a single query for the unstable/cvs version:

{{{
config_query MPLAYER_CVS "Build CVS version?" n
}}}

For versions downloading from a source code management system, the spell should also ask the user whether he wants to update that spell automatically on every {{{sorcery [system-update|queue]}}}:

{{{
if [[ "${FVWM_RELEASE}" == "cvs" ]]; then
  config_query FVWM_CVS_AUTOUPDATE "Update on every system update?" n
fi
}}}

The actual multi-version handling is done in [[Spell/Files/DETAILS|DETAILS]]:
{{{
           SPELL=mplayer
if [ "$MPLAYER_CVS" == "y" ]; then
  if [ "$MPLAYER_CVS_AUTOUPDATE" == "y" ]; then
         VERSION=$(date +%Y%m%d)
  else
         VERSION=cvs
