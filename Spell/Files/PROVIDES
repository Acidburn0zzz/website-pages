= PROVIDES =

The PROVIDES file is used to contain information about what generic dependencies a [[Spell|spell]] provides.

The format of this file is a simple list of uppercase provider names, separated by newlines.

For instance, [[http://www.exim.org/|exim]], [[http://www.postfix.org/|postfix]] and [[http://www.sendmail.org/|sendmail]] are mailer daemons, so they provide {{{MAIL-TRANSPORT-AGENT}}}.

Example from mozilla:

{{{
MOZILLA-BROWSER
EMAIL-CLIENT
WEB-BROWSER
GRAPHICAL-WEB-BROWSER
GECKO
NS-PLUGIN-COMPATIBLE
}}}

You use the provider just like any other dependency:

{{{
depends GECKO &&

suggest_depends WEB-BROWSER "" "" "for browsing the html docs"
}}}

So when something needs a pager, you don't put in your favourite one, but {{{PAGER}}} and let the user choose the provider.

When adding a spell to an existing provider (e.g. adding a new provider for {{{GECKO}}}), **all** spells using that provider have to work with the new spell or need to be fixed.

**Warning:** provider names should not match spell names regardless their case.

**Note:** due to historical reasons, another syntax using {{{provides <PROVIDER>}}} is also supported, but should not be used.
