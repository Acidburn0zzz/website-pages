= INSTALL =

This file controls the actual install process.

If the INSTALL file is not present in the [[Spell|spell]], [[Sorcery/Commands/Cast|cast]] uses {{{default_install}}} //(remember, {{{FUNCTIONS}}} file in [[Grimoire|grimoire]] root/section can redefine (replace) this function)//:

{{{
make install
}}}

**Note:** this {{{default_install}}} function is for the [[Grimoire/API|build api]] 2 only! In build api 1, {{{make install}}} is included in [[Spell/Files/BUILD|BUILD]].
