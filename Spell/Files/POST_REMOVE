= POST_REMOVE =

POST_REMOVE is used to do any cleanup that might be necessary after a [[Spell|spell]] is [[Sorcery/Commands/Dispel|dispelled]].

As an example, "lilo" leaves default bitmap image in {{{/boot}}} because it is a protected location:

{{{
# /boot is protected, we remove /boot/boot.bmp by hand
rm -f "$INSTALL_ROOT/boot/boot.bmp"
}}}
