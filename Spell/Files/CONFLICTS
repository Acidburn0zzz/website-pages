= CONFLICTS =

This file lists other [[Spell|spells]] that conflict against the spell being installed.

While this file is a normally extensible script, it must not output anything else but what the {{{conflicts}}} function calls would.

Example:

{{{
conflicts freeglut
}}}

And for multiple conflicts:

{{{
conflicts freeglut &&
conflicts openglut
}}}

Self-conflicts //(useful during [[Sorcery/Commands/Cast|cast]] when older libraries of a spell prevent from successful compile/linking phase)// should default to yes:

{{{
conflicts kdelibs y
}}}
