= PRE_REMOVE =

PRE_REMOVE is used to prepare a [[Spell|spell]] for removal. This is only necessary in a few special cases.

An example from the "shadow" spell:

{{{
# Restore /etc/passwd when dispelling shadow
${INSTALL_ROOT}/usr/sbin/pwunconv &&
${INSTALL_ROOT}/usr/sbin/grpunconv
}}}

//(done in PRE_REMOVE because those commands are installed by "shadow", thus aren't available after the [[Sorcery/Commands/Dispel|dispel]])//
