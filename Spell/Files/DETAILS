== Variables ==

**SPELL**

This specifies the name of the spell you are creating. It must be lower case (we let the developers of the application choose the way they'd like it spelled).

{{{
SPELL="xzgv"
}}}

**VERSION**

This specifies the current version number of the application in question. Please be exact.

{{{
VERSION="0.7"
}}}

**SOURCE**

Specifies the name of the source file of the application. Must be the full name not including any path information.

{{{
SOURCE="${SPELL}-${VERSION}.tar.gz"
}}}

**SOURCEn**

Specifies the names of additional source files for the application. The numbering starts with "2".

{{{
SOURCE2="xzgv-addons.tar.gz"
}}}

**SOURCE_DIRECTORY**

Used to specify the location where the source will be unpacked. You must pay special attention to the naming of the directory when unpacking the source file (i.e. if the subdirectory is {{{${SPELL}-${VERSION}}}}, or perhaps just {{{${SPELL}}}}, etc.). {{{${BUILD_DIRECTORY}}}} is a special variable which is set by the sorcery tools to allow you to not have to worry about where sorcery will unpack the source from, currently sorcery uses {{{/usr/src}}} to begin the unpacking of the application's source.

{{{
SOURCE_DIRECTORY="${BUILD_DIRECTORY}/${SPELL}-${VERSION}"
}}}

**SOURCEn_DIRECTORY**

Used to specify the location for multiple source directories where 'n' is a positive integer.

{{{
SOURCE2_DIRECTORY="${BUILD_DIRECTORY}/x509-${VERSION2}-${SPELL}-${VERSION}"
}}}

**SOURCE_URL[*]**

An array where you specify as many targets of where to download the source from. Must specify the full path (including filename) of the application source, so it is known where to download the spell from. Incrementing the number in the []'s will add additional entries, attempted in numerical order.

{{{
SOURCE_URL[0]=http://xzgv.browser.org/${SOURCE}
}}}

**SOURCEn_URL[*]**

Arrays specifying the download links for additional {{{SOURCEn}}} entries. The numbering starts with "2" (i.e. {{{SOURCE2_URL}}}).

{{{
SOURCE2_URL[0]=http://xzgv.browser.org/${SOURCE2}
}}}

You can use special global variables already pre-defined by [[Sorcery]], e.g. URL for [[http://sourceforge.net/|SourceForge]] project:

{{{
SOURCE_URL[0]=${SOURCEFORGE_URL}/${SPELL}/${SOURCE}
}}}

**FORCE_DOWNLOAD**

When set to 'on', the source will be downloaded by sorcery, regardless of it being present in the spool directory.

{{{
FORCE_DOWNLOAD=on
FORCE_DOWNLOAD[2]=on # for SOURCE2 not SOURCE[2]!
FORCE_DOWNLOAD[n]=on # for SOURCEn not SOURCE[n]!
}}}

**SOURCE_HASH/SOURCEn_HASH**

The hash of the source file. Consists of {{{<algorithm>:<hash>:<verification level>}}}. The algorithm we currently use is sha512. Verification level can be either {{{WORKS_FOR_ME}}} (no verification done) or other verification levels listed in [[Source integrity checking standards]]. The second form is for multiple hash verifications, where 'n' is a positive integer.

{{{
SOURCE_HASH=sha512:cf83e1357eefb8bdf1542850d66d8007d620e4050b5715dc83f4a921d36ce9ce47d0d13c5d85f2b0ff8318d2877eec2f63b931bd47417a81a538327af927da3e:UPSTREAM_HASH
}}}

**SOURCE_GPG/SOURCEn_GPG**

A signature used to verify the source file. Consists of {{{<key file>:<signature file>:<verification level>}}}. The key file has to exist in either the spell, the section or the grimoire the spell is in. The signature should be in the spell or downloaded by the spell. Verification levels are listed in [[Source integrity checking standards]]. See [[Spell/GPG checking|Spell GPG checking]] for details about how to generate a key.

The second form is for multiple source verifications, there 'n' is a positive integer.

{{{
SOURCE_GPG="gurus.gpg:${SOURCE}.sig:WORKS_FOR_ME"
}}}

**SOURCE_IGNORE/SOURCEn_IGNORE**

This can be used instead of {{{SOURCE_GPG}}} or {{{SOURCE_HASH}}} to tell sorcery not to check the file. The content of this variable states the reason why it shouldn't be checked. It can be one of:
* //signature// -- the source is an upstream GPG signature
* //unversioned// -- the source changes without changing its filename
* //volatile// -- the source is downloaded from a version control system like CVS, Subversion, Git or Mercurial

{{{
SOURCE2_IGNORE=signature
}}}

**WEB_SITE**

Used to document the applications "official" website (if there is one).

{{{
WEB_SITE=http://xzgv.browser.org/
}}}

**ENTERED**

This is a numerical string indicating the date this spell was "officially" created. Set this to the day you submit the spell for approval.

{{{
ENTERED=20020406
}}}

**PATCHLEVEL**

The number of revisions a spell has gone through without changing {{{VERSION}}}. This defaults to "0" if ommited. Any change to a spell that should trigger a rebuild on all systems using that spell should have {{{PATCHLEVEL}}} updated. On a {{{VERSION}}} change {{{PATCHLEVEL}}} should be removed.

{{{
PATCHLEVEL=2
}}}

**SECURITY_PATCH**

The number of security related spell changes or version updates the spell has gone through. This number is used by {{{sorcery queue-security}}} to determine what spells need to be rebuilt for security reasons.

{{{
SECURITY_PATCH=3
}}}

**Note:** {{{SECURITY_PATCH}}} must never be reset.

**LICENSE[*]**

Specifies the licenses this application has been released under. Please use the acronym where applicable. The array elements correspond to the different source files in the same way as the MD5 array elements.

{{{
LICENSE[0]=GPL
LICENSE[1]=FDL
}}}

**KEYWORDS**

A list of lowercased generic single-word descriptions of a package for easier search.

{{{
KEYWORDS="python www"
}}}

**SHORT**

A brief description of the spell. What it is, it's purpose etc. Used primarily by the [[Sorcery/Commands/Gaze|gaze]] command of the sorcery tools.

{{{
SHORT="GTK+/Imlib-based picture viewer for X"
}}}

**DOCS**

Optional tag used to override the implicit {{{DOCS}}} variable to change what docs are installed. Only copies files, for dirs use {{{DOC_DIRS}}} instead.

{{{
DOCS="README* FAQ* CHAN* DOC* SETUP LICENSE COPYING NEWS *rc"
DOCS="README* BUGS NEWS COPYING data/COPYING.* docs/example.lircrc"
DOCS="$DOCS etc/*.conf"
}}}

**DOC_DIRS**

Optional tag used to override the implicit {{{DOC_DIRS}}} variable to change what doc dirs are installed. Only copies dirs and their contents.

{{{
DOC_DIRS="doc* conf"
}}}

**GATHER_DOCS**

Used to enable or disable gathering of docs defined in {{{DOCS}}} and {{{DOC_DIRS}}} (both can be pre-defined in {{{/etc/sorcery/config}}}).

{{{
GATHER_DOCS="off"
}}}

**ARCHIVE**

This forces the enabling or disabling to archive a spell. The option is either "on" or "off". This should be set to "off" when the spell is a binary install. \\ Otherwise, this should remain untouched, as this is a variable set by user's preferences.

{{{
ARCHIVE="off"
}}}

**REJECT**

This is a short description of why a spell was rejected. This should be present for spells in [[Grimoire/z-rejected|z-rejected]] grimoire.

{{{
REJECT="has licensing issues"
}}}
----

After all of the entries have been made for the details file. The last thing should be the long description for this spell. Used to give a more lengthy description of what this spell is and it's common uses etc. The description must be aligned to 80 characters (no line should exceed the 80th character).

{{{
cat << EOF
xzgv is a GTK+/Imlib-based picture viewer for X, which supports most popular
image formats. It provides a thumbnail-based file selector, and allows panning and
fit-to-window methods of viewing. It has mouse support as well, but can be
used solely from the keyboard.
EOF
}}}
----

== Deprecated variables ==

**UPDATED**

This is a numerical string indicating the date this spell was last changed. Used as a reference for the sorcery scripts to know if a spell has been updated (this forces a recompile so only update for non-version updates that need a recompile; version updates and non-recompile-needed changes should not touch this variable).

{{{
UPDATED=20020406
}}}

**Note:** This is still supported, but shouldn't be used anymore. Instead use {{{PATCHLEVEL}}} or {{{SECURITY_PATCH}}} as applicable.
