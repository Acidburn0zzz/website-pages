= PREPARE =

This script is run only during dependency resolution. It is sourced before any other [[Spell|spell]] script, i.e. before [[Spell/Files/DETAILS|DETAILS]] even. It is to be used in the rare case of scripting being needed in DETAILS.

The following variables are available in PREPARE:

|= Variable =|= Description/value =|
| {{{SOURCE_CACHE}}} | the directory where the sources reside ({{{/var/spool/sorcery}}}) |
| {{{SPELL_DIRECTORY}}} | the spell script directory in the [[Codex]] ({{{/path/to/<grimoire>/<section>/<spell>}}}) |
| {{{SCRIPT_DIRECTORY}}} | the same as {{{${SPELL_DIRECTORY}}}} |
| {{{SECTION_DIRECTORY}}} | {{{/path/to/<grimoire>/<section>}}} |
| {{{GRIMOIRE}}} | {{{/path/to/<grimoire>}}} |

For more info on these variables, check {{{/var/lib/sorcery/modules/libcodex}}}.

Here's an example of PREPARE of "cherrypy" spell:

{{{
config_query_list BRANCH "which branch?" 3 2
}}}

An important usecase for PREPARE is in [[Spell/Multiversion|multiversion spells]].
