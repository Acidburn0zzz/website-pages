= PREPARE =

This script is run only during dependency resolution. It is sourced before any other spell script, i.e. before [[Spell/Files/DETAILS|DETAILS]] even. It is to be used in the rare case of scripting being needed in DETAILS. The scripting can be moved out of DETAILS and into PREPARE. PREPARE would assign strings to variables such as {{{PREPARE_VERSION="2.1.3"}}}, and then DETAILS is able to avoid scripting and it can put {{{VERSION=${PREPARE_VERSION:-none}}}} in.

**Note:** the {{{${VAR:-string}}}} syntax means if {{{$VAR}}} is not empty, then use {{{$VAR}}}, if it is empty, then use the //"string"//.

The following variables are available in PREPARE:
* SOURCE_CACHE: the directory where the sources reside: {{{/var/spool/sorcery}}}
* SPELL_DIRECTORY: the spell script directory in the codex: {{{/path/to/<grimoire>/<section>/<spell>}}}
* SCRIPT_DIRECTORY: this is the same as {{{${SPELL_DIRECTORY}}}}
* SECTION_DIRECTORY: {{{/path/to/<grimoire>/<section>}}}
* GRIMOIRE: {{{/path/to/<grimoire>}}}

For more info on these variables, check {{{/var/lib/sorcery/modules/libcodex}}}.

An important usecase for PREPARE is in [[Spell/Multi version|multi version spells]].
