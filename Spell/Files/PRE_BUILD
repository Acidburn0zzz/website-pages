= PRE_BUILD =

The PRE_BUILD file is executed by [[Sorcery/Commands/Cast|cast]] before the [[Spell/Files/BUILD|BUILD]] file.

Anything necessary to prepare the [[Spell|spell]] to be built should be done here, like patching or unpacking additional sources. Usually this is done by adding commands after {{{default_pre_build}}}, which unpacks the first source automatically:

{{{
default_pre_build &&
cd "$SOURCE_DIRECTORY" &&
unpack_file 2 &&

patch -p0 < "$SPELL_DIRECTORY/gcc4.patch"
}}}

Another use for this file is for spells using badly packaged sources that don't unpack into a directory:

{{{
mk_source_dir "$SOURCE_DIRECTORY" &&
cd "$SOURCE_DIRECTORY" &&
unpack_file
}}}
