= Spell definition =

Spell is a set of instructions contained in the [[Grimoire]] which tell [[Sorcery]] how to obtain, configure, compile, and install programs. Each program has its own directory in {{{/var/lib/sorcery/codex/<grimoire>/<section>/<spell>}}} containing the files with this information.
