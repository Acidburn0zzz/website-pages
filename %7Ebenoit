**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

In August 1997, I earn enough money to buy my first computer and I immediately installed Debian 1.0 on it, cause I wanted to use a Unix like system. I still use Debian nowadays, while I've tried several other distributions including Mandrake, RedHat and nALFS.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I just started this month (May 2003). It's an interesting source based GNU/Linux distribution.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

It has a small install system along with bootable ISO so that it's easy to install like any other distributions. \\ And its source based approach seems the best way to have an optimized and up to date system.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

Personaly, I'd like to see a system that can be installed with the best suited kernel for a particular machine or needs. \\ But I think the ISO content building process should be examined first.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I have always been curious about computer and internet. Computers are a way to change ideas into reality and internet main goal is to share those ideas. As part of my studies, I've an engineering degree from [[http://www.enst-bretagne.fr|ENSTB]]. I've use GNU/Linux in my day to day work (even for making professional documentation).

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

If you were able to install and use SMGL, don't hesitate, contribute ! Any help is welcome. (doc writing, translations)

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

In order : Solaris, HP-UX, Linux, Windows 9x, 2000, XP. I've done programming on all those system.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

**KDE or GNOME?**

icewm since it's fast and only do what I need.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL.

== Strictly personal ==

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

My dream car would be a GPL'ed car, so that every part can be improved by individual users. \\ I see most of you with a small smile, but ... embedded software is becoming a major part or today's car.
