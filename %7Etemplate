**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I remember I ordered a slackware distribution on two dozen floppy disks as soon as I had a i386 system at hand. Why linux? At that time there were free bsd variants available but I chose linux for no particular reason. I did have access to an AIX system before so there was never the question whether to try unix.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since around spring 2004.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

With linux from scratch it was too bothersome to stay up to date. Some other distributions I tried had way too much glue. Didn't like gentoo. Then found Sorcerer but back then it looked like a dying project to me. Source Mage had a nice social contract, and lots of friendly traffic.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

Source Mage has improved a lot since I first tried it. Many exciting technologies got implemented and all in all it is the most stable distribution I ever had installed. Let's keep it that way.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I studied CS in Bonn and spent ten years as a freelancer in projects of varying size. Usually as a programmer but occasionally also responsible for technical design, architecture or technical project management. Topics included reverse engineering, data mining, content management, network programming and even openGL vizualizations. I also did some research on metaprogramming and plugin architectures.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

This is a great community, keep the spirit!

If you don't know it, come, join and participate!

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Linux, Plan9, Irix, IBM RS-6000, avoided Windows where feasible. Can write and read 15 programming languages fluently and have toyed around with many more.
