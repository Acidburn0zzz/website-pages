== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Well I quit using Windows in 2000 because in my attempts to understand HOW it worked I kept getting dead ends. I started using FreeBSD in 2000, during the whole 4.7-5.0 shift I started playing with Linux Distros. I installed and toyed Mandrake, Red Hat, and Suse before understanding that I hate rpms. Then many distros latter Debian was good except it was too automatic and everything was outdated. So then I found Source Mage GNU/Linux 0.5 and it is everything I could want in a Linux Distro, and is quickly becoming more.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I installed Source Mage GNU/Linux 0.5 :-)

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

It's package management system and use of simple bash scripts. I'm all about keeping it simple, because simple is beautiful.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

A large percent of GNU/Linux systems in Georgia!

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I have gone to school at several Georgia Colleges and will probably continue, I've been doing tech support for years now and some freelance work. My current goal is to join the geekcorps program.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Vote in November! \\ Come because of the installer, stay because of the package management?

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Well I was involved with the FreeBSD project pre-5.0. But other than toying with nearly every linux distro under the sun, Source Mage is the first project to really capture me. Though I'm also professionally trained in Solaris and I toy with many different hobby OS projects like SkyOS and React OS.
