= New to Source Mage =

== Introduction ==

Welcome to [[About|Source Mage GNU/Linux]] and congratulations on a succesful [[Install|install]]!

This is a brief introduction to Source Mage GNU/Linux //(SMGL)//. It will only cover those subjects required for basic use. For a more in-depth look, please see the manpages, current [[Docs|web-documentation]], and the [[Contact/Mailing Lists|mailing lists]]. You are also welcome to join our [[Contact/IRC|IRC]] channel [[irc://irc.freenode.net/#sourcemage|#sourcemage]] on [[irc://irc.freenode.net|irc.freenode.net]], where you'll find active support for most of the time.

== Basic terminology ==

The Source Mage tagline is: "**Linux so advanced, it may as well be magic.**". Basic terminology is similarily magic-oriented. Program packages are called [[Spell|spells]], and a collection of spells is called a [[Grimoire]]. All installed grimoires likewise make up the [[Codex]].

Installing a spell is called "casting", and removing it is called "dispelling". Such terms are not only figures of speech, though: {{{cast}}} and {{{dispel}}} are also 
the programs used to perform the said tasks.

== Spells ==

A spell is simply a directory containing script files that are used for downloading, unpacking, configuring, compiling, and installing a program. The actual source is not included in the spell, but is downloaded directly from the program's own website.

Spells are stored in section directories inside the grimoire directories. The grimoires themselves are located in the codex directory {{{/var/lib/sorcery/codex}}}. For instance, the spell from stable grimoire for the [[http://gcc.gnu.org/|GNU C compiler]], called "gcc", is located in {{{/var/lib/sorcery/codex/stable/gnu/gcc}}}.

Different grimoires exist for different kinds of spells. The [[Grimoire/stable|stable]] and [[Grimoire/test|test]] grimoires contain spells for most programs. Non-Free and binary spells belong in the [[Grimoire/z-rejected|z-rejected]] and [[Grimoire/binary|binary]] grimoires respectively, and games belong in the [[Grimoire/games|games]] grimoire.

== The Sorcery suite of scripts ==

The Source Mage collection of system tools is called [[Sorcery]]. It contains [[Sorcery/Commands|utilities]] for different system management tasks whose names reflect SMGL's "magical" theme.

The main program, used for modifying core system behavior, is also named "sorcery".

The utilities you'll need the most in everyday use are:

* [[Sorcery/Commands/Sorcery|sorcery]]

The command {{{sorcery}}} opens a menu where you can modify the behavior and appearance of all sorcery tools. Also available are e.g. compiler optimization settings, as well as a menu-based interface for spell management. {{{sorcery}}} also has command-line options that are used e.g. for doing system updates.

* [[Sorcery/Commands/Cast|cast]]

Casting spells, an activity most other distributions refer to as "installing packages", is done with {{{cast}}}. Generally this means typing {{{cast <spell>}}}, answering some queries pertaining to the spell, and allowing the {{{cast}}} to download, compile, and install the program.

* [[Sorcery/Commands/Dispel|dispel]]

Uninstalling spells is done with {{{dispel}}}. It operates like {{{cast}}}, with the difference that there usually aren't any queries to answer, and it takes a lot less time than casting.

* [[Sorcery/Commands/Gaze|gaze]]

{{{gaze}}} is used to retrieve information about spells or about your system. For example you can use {{{gaze search <phrase>}}} and {{{gaze}}} will search all available packages for mention of the phrase you entered. You can read any spell's description by doing {{{gaze what <spell>}}}.

* [[Sorcery/Commands/Scribe|scribe]]

Scribe is a utility for controlling the grimoires in your codex, and the spells in your grimoires. For example, you can use {{{scribe add stable}}} to add "stable" to your grimoires. {{{scribe remove stable}}} would then remove it. Scribe is also used for updating the spells in your grimoire using the command {{{scribe update}}}.

**Note:** You can see all available options for each utility by typing {{{<utility> --help}}}.
