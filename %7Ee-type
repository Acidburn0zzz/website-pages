**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

First contact was in october 2003 by downloading Morphix, which I didn't get to work very well, then MEPIS, which was easier then XP, but the only satisfaction it gave me was the fact that I wasn't on a windows box, but still didn't know anything of linux. Next I tried CORE-linux which was out of my league and finally switched to SMGL, wich satisfied and stimulated both my intelligence and knowledge.

My reason to start using linux was twofold.

First of all, I had by using OpenOffice.org learned about this really odd human behaviour of sharing knowledge for free, as is btw stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 27, first part only because the second part starts about protection of material interests.

Secondly, I was experiencing some internal conflict about using XP on my box without a license. My brothers had bought another PC, I inherited some of their old components, but they wanted their license.

So I ventured new paths and wandered into the lovely world of linux.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

This question deserves a very clear and straightforward answer.

Linux is all about freely sharing the advances in technology, and compiling your whole system from source allows you to have a very perfomant system while using the latest possible versions of all your software.

The most important strength of SMGL is that the administrator is in full control of the what packages are installed on his system.

In Windows or MEPIS, you get everything installed just in case you might ever need it.

SMGL installs nothing, and the administrator decides what he needs, thus what is installed. \\ SMGL allows the administrator to have full control of the system in an easily accessible way.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

WORLD DOMINATION, but only if the right steps in the field of accessibility are taken.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I'm currently studying for "Commercial Engineer in IT-management" which holds a basis of economics, (mostly IT-)management and languages, added with a lot of sciences and technical IT-subjects to know what the geeks in the company are talking about when they report to the managers.

I'm one of the four persons in charge of a team of 50 leaders of my 250 members scouts-group. I'm also responsible for all the financial aspects concerning our group. We've got an online administration site since shortly.

Off course I've been a member all my life. This has in part made me who I am, and how I function in a group.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Make sure the paperboy does his job!

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

a bit on a lot

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

jEdit

**KDE or GNOME?**

I came from windows being sick of Microsoft holding my hand in everything, so why would I allow KDE or GNOME to do the exact same thing?

evilwm all the way, sometimes WindowMaker or Fluxbox when I want eyecandy.

**BSD or GPL?**

usable software ;-)

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Hell yes! I got two brothers which mean the world to me, one girlfriend, same story as my brothers, 2 parents that still love eachother and to whom I owe all I have (and that's true!)

Any further-away family is also very important, since once I'm in real trouble in this world, they will be ready for me, like I am for them.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Any car I'd buy pure for non-functional purposes is my dream car (e-type?) \\ I'll probably end up in a van :-)

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**
