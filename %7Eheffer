**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started using Linux at an early stage of the 1.1 kernels. I first tried Novell-DOS, then Win3.0, and then OS/2 (huh, was it the 2.0 release before warp ??? i think yes). When I told a good friend of mine that I was using OS/2 for doing my stuff he advised me to have a deeper look on linux. Since internet was unbelievably expensive in these days I bought a slackware-cdrom and managed to install that distribution. Since then I was addicted to linux. 

Have you ever tried to open as many shells as you could and in all copy a file from cd-rom to hd just to try out this thing called "multitasking" ??? Hell, was this impressive :o)

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Hmmm, hmmmm, somewhere between late november and early december 2001.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I liked the idea of building everything from the sources, then there was this freshmeat announcement about sorcery -- it wasn't yet the distribution but only a system to build up software from the sources. I never tried it since I was pretty convinced that the distribution I already ran on my systems was ok. As time passed by I was curious whether sorcery/sgl was what I needed. I just tried out -- now I'm addicted.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

SMGL is a great distribution, once you manage to install it and make familiar with administration-thingies. I think this is what the most people are afraid of : The installation procedure isn't that easy it could be. I believe that in some day the installation will be much easier due to automatic configuration scripts (hey, perhaps one could use hwinfo for checking your hardware and then automatically configure your first kernel's build). Till then SMGL will be for purists only.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Some people would describe me as introverted yet autistic...

At this time I'm doing my studies as business administrator focused on information technology (in german : Diplom Kaufmann Fachrichtung Wirtschaftsinformatik) at the university of applied sciences in Berlin. Every three months I do an internship at Siemens for about three other months. I try to focus them on using my skills as system-administrator or to enhance my programming skills.

As I mentioned I am rather introverted -- but if people try to communicate with me, they can be sure to get a response -- a short but good one ;-)

What else about me ??? I like drinking lots of beer and getting up late the next day.

**Do you have any family?**

My real family lives 400 kilometers away from my current geographical position. In Berlin my friends are my family.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Unfortunately I do not have the money to drive a car -- either I haven't driven a car since 3 years or so :o(( My dream car is a mercedes-wolf -- one of the cars I have driven at my time in the army...
