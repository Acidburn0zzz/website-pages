**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

First started using Linux because, quite some time ago now, I was an Amiga guy. Hated i386 boxes and the Windows crap everyone was starting to run on them. Clunky, buggy, wimpy. The time came when my Amiga bit the dust and there was no company around to service it... at least not at PC prices. So, vowing not to 'do' the Windows thing, I bought a pentium box and put FreeBSD on it. After running that for awhile and not being too happy with it, someone (thankfully) introduced me to Slackware. After that, and a few distributions later, we arrived at SMGL.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since before it was SMGL.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

It was source based and actually worked well. Anyone ever try Rock Linux?

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

An SMGL CD being flung at, and whapping the leg of Bill Gates.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

EDumAKayshWHAT?!?

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Howdy!

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Officially? None, I guess.

**Do you have any family?**

Tons! None that I've created myself, but... oh, wait a sec, you can't really do that yourself. hmm.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Make up your mind. I drive a '94 Maxima. My dream car? Maybe a McLaren.
