**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I think I started using Linux in 1996 or so, on and off. Mostly for work-related things (IE, remote coding through telnet). Every now and then I'd try to install it on my home system, which would usually turn out to be a complete failure (I tend to turn linux installs to mush if given the chance. :-). I started using it heavily in 2000 when I got into college, when I finally got it installed on my home system. Slackware to RedHat (briefly, due to the urgings of an old roomate) to Debian to SMGL. :-)

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since May 2002, I believe.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

Mostly because it allowed me to be lazy like I was on Debian, yet still have everything be compiled from source and "Just Work" (tm).

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I don't really see SMGL as a mainstream distro. I think it'll be popular in a little niche, but not much beyond that. All from my observations on the reactions I get from people when I tell them about it. Although I am prepared to be proven wrong.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Well, I'm currently studying Computer Science in college. I'm also a licensed ham (KG6SGU). In more than one way. :-)

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Use the Source, Duke!

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vim

**KDE or GNOME?**

Neither. I use straight E (enlightenment).

**BSD or GPL?**

I follow the idea of "Use what works". Use whatever is best for the project.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Other than the normal father/mother/sister, no.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Currently I drive a white '95 Chevy Blazer. It's very nice.

Dream car? I don't know. No real dream car, but next I plan to buy a silver Chevy Silverado 1500 or a silver Chevy S10 pickup. Just something to get me up to the mountains in the winter so I can hit the fresh powder on my snowboard. :-)

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

I don't have any copies myself. I try and avoid cameras like the plague if I can.
