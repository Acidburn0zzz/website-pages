**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

My Windows XP installation effed over and I needed to find a way to back up my files. I downloaded and burned Knoppix to get those files, and that was my very first use of Linux. After that my first on-disk install attempt was Gentoo because I thought I was pretty advanced at using computers. I knew it wouldn't be easy. In foresight, I almost had it installed, but I would have had so much trouble afterward anyway. So I trotted over to Debian and I installed that successfully, and I had a good run. I then went back to Gentoo, used it for a while, then I tried to install Ubuntu on occasions, failed on those occasions, went back to Debian, and then I found SMGL.

I've been using Linux ever since.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since mid 2008.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I like DnD, I like Linux, and I was fed up with the feel of Gentoo's community. Also, Portage screwed me to the wall more times than I can describe. Initially I thought SMGL was too anal about "Do you want to have feature X" about 20 times for a fresh install, but then I discovered that this is one of the most controllable distros ever.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I personally see it always being a specific community being built towards a specific userbase. I like it as it is, and it has a solid base of packages on it. The future I believe can be nothing but good.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I am going to go to my local community college to take classes in computer science to see where exactly I want to go in computers. I know a bit beyond basic C/C++, less-than intermediate Bash, and I was cracking down on Python.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Learn the commands {{{man}}}, {{{apropos}}}, and {{{whatis}}} please.

I'll help you regardless, but it's better if you have some prior knowledge, at least.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I've worked on vifm, but that was a personal thing. I never submitted anything.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Vim

**KDE or GNOME?**

screen/fluxbox

**BSD or GPL?**

Doesn't matter.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Barely. Or maybe I don't care to know about most of them. *shrugs*

**What other hobbies?**

Screwing my computer over.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Bike or legs. And if those fail, crawl.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

Nah.
