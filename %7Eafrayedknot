== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I tried linux out a few times, first starting around 1998. In 2001 I decided to ditch my tired windows 95 install for good. I switched because I wanted to be more in touch with how my computer was operating, I felt that proprietary offerings were too unstable and opaque. I also wanted to get involved in an open source project and become more familiar with how computers operate. Or something.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since 2002.. and stuff.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I wanted a source based distribution that mirrored upstream defaults, one that was ideally an automated version of Linux From Scratch.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I work as a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area. I graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2003 with a degree in Computer Science. \\ http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/5a4/718

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

The most important thing is to have fun with it.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Mostly work stuff. I worked on a storage cluster at one job, then on navigation software, presently I work under NDA.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

I usually use vim, sometimes I use nano, but only when there isn't vim or vim is configured in such a way that I cannot use it.

**KDE or GNOME?**

I don't really care so long as I can get to a bash prompt. If I have a choice I usually setup pwm.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL for all of my code at least. But I don't have an issue with BSD.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Yes, mostly in California.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I drive a toyota pickup truck, and a jeep wrangler 4x4. Both have 5 speed manual transmissions.

My former car (which was at one point a dream car) was a red '88 jeep cherokee pioneer, to the best of my knowledge it is still working and being driven around the reno nevada area. Another dream car is one with a rotary engine, having bought and sold a mazda rx8 I can write that one off the list. (why not?)
