**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Erm, my first contact with Linux was with RedHat 5.0, I can't remember the excact year. It has been a while ago ;-)

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I installed Sorcerer in April 2002, played with it for a while, but couldn't update much. (I was on a pay-per-minute 56k connection).

I switched to Slackware in september 2002 (Bad me, I know) and then to SMGL around march 2003 and I got hopelessly hooked to it.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

It doesn't try to think for me, it's source based and the developers are very active.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

World Domination, obviously :-)

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I dropped out of school (Information Technology) to work for the IT department of a major oil company for a few years. \\ Currently I'm working as resident BOFH for a small company which seems to do something with insurance ;-)

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I used to try every os that I could get my hands on. \\ I've been using a LOT of Linux distros, various Windows flavours, minix, Solaris, AIX, and a little Novell.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vim

**KDE or GNOME?**

I don't particularly like GNOME nor KDE. "Awesome" is my wm of choice lately

**BSD or GPL?**
