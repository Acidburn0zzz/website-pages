== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

My first experiments with Linux took place back in 1998, at this time, in France, a lot of magazine began to propose a cd with a linux distro. I remember I was a little scared before partitioning my drive to install RedHat 5.1. Since then I've used Linux -- not at 100% though, since the audio/video applications weren't as many & useful as they are today... But, hey, I like coding so linux one of the dream OS for that.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I installed SGL just one or two weeks before the forks. As soon as I've installed it, I understood the true power it had, and I immediately asked Kyle to maintain the multimedia section (I wasn't aware of all the things going on....). When the forks occured, I chose to stay with on the GPL side -- Lunar looked like a commercial project to me...

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

At first, the possibility to have a **fast** linux box -- as opposed to the binary-distros, whose I always found slooooow.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

Brilliant. What is the most amazing thing with SMGL, over speed and customization, is the true modularity of the system. One can build a server, or a desktop workstation, or an enhanced multimedia station, etc..., just by using the patched kernels, and selecting spells...

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Wow. Basically I'm a musician (20 years piano) who have been computing non-stop since....1984 (with an Alice -- a beast !! Motorola 6803 - 0,89MHz - 4Kb RAM :-P)

Right now I'm doing my PhD thesis in Computer Music. I've got my masters in Music & Computer Music. -- will surely try to grab a masters in AI or something like that too...

No career atm, but I consider everything related to computers and/or music... =)

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Yes. Even if it's sometimes hard, keep the distro going, spread the word!

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Well -- almost everyone I guess. BeOS was fun, but closed, same with QNX. I like trying every OS around (AtheOS, Plan9, etc...)... and I'm always looking for non-x86 hardware... specially SGI -- contact me if you got [another] one to give =)

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Definitely emacs.

**KDE or GNOME?**

KDE, but I'm quite open to others (gnome 1 was ugly, will have a look at 2).

UPDATE: gnome2 is still ugly -- I'll keep with KDE 3 until e17 is out (if it ever is...). I use WM when I need fast feedback from the system when doing live sets.

UPDATE: I now use openbox (2) for everything...

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL -- I don't like the fact a closed source project can 'steal' open source developments.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Yes. A wife and a 3-year old daughter.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

The kind with four wheels and a steering-wheel. I **really** don't care about cars, so the only I dream of is a working one =)

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

Nah- I'm not brave. Plus I don't have a single digit one... Maybe some day....
