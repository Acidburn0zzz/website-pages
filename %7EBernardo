**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started using Linux in 1999-2000, and I think it was SUSE. I grabbed a NT4 file server (white line), and put it to use as a department file server using samba. By then I was fed up with windows instability and bad design, but already knew OS/2 (my choice os until then) had been abandoned by IBM a few years before.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Well, in the beginning of 2000 I was getting frustrated with how easy Mandrake was to install and maintain, but hard to tweak and to keep up to date with the most bleeding edge software. I started hunting for distributions that would be more "bare-bones", where I could control more easily, and Sorcerer got my interest. When Salee took it offline, it was only logical to follow the guys I liked best and who had "saved" the distribution. So I went with SMGL even when Sorcerer reappeared (non-gpl).

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

The very simple packaging system, writing and sharing spells is so easy and cool! Well, at least was easy until I tried my hand at OpenOffice and j2sdk...

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I think it will be a distribution for the same kind of guy that would use bsd if it were gpl... It's easy to use and to maintain, and smooth to run...

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I'm 37 years old, project manager at a large bank, which basically means I got a job that pays my salary trying to control two teams of outsourcing companies. I've been a programmer, a analyst, a network administrator and third level help desk, a technical consultant, etc... I'm always looking for more technical work, preferably outside of Portugal -- any offers?

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Have fun, and give back... We always need more people.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

My first computer was a ZX-Spectrum. Then at the university we had a unisys unix computer (don't know which). At work I used DOS, DOS16M (a dos extender), win 3.1, 98, NT, 2000. Also a little Solaris and Linux. At home, OS/2, then Linux.

SMGL is my first active role in a big development.

== Flamewars ==

**KDE or GNOME?**

KDE... Gnome is here just to run gnucash.

**BSD or GPL?**

I'd use the GPL license my self but I've nothing against BSD people, it's really a matter of personal choice. I just don't want my work being used by the "beast of redmond". At least, not if they don't pay me...

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Married and one baby girl on the way, expected to arrive by the end of February.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I have a Cherokee, a 2000 model, before they become jeeps for girls... I'd love to have a Ferrari...

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

Yeah, right... And two negatives make a positive but two positives don't make a negative... Yeah, right...
