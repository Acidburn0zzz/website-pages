== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Not really sure what sparked it, tried some slackware cd in a magazine, I had a hard time with it, so I went to a bookstore and picked up some SuSE CDs, man was that cool, and it had kernel 2.0.34 so my RH "friends" couldn't even teardrop me.....good time. Overall I like linux because the only thing that stops me from fixing a problem I come across is time or my ability to learn something new.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Well, since May 2006 :-)

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

That it is source based and has a nice community, that they have CDs with working installers for many architectures. Been using Gentoo Linux before I encountered SMGL, found it luckily at the right time. And have been enjoying the ride.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I too just hope SMGL stays true to what makes it great now and doesn't follow all the other good distros toward "only having the most users matters". Maybe it's selfish but I'm tired of looking for a new distro that just does what I want. </shamelessplug>

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Enjoy and Thanks.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Aside from making sure IceWM builds for me, I have maintained boost, povray, tightvnc and others.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vim!

**KDE or GNOME?**

If you were serious, KDE, but since you are not, let me be serious: IceWM!

**BSD or GPL?**

I don't have a clue. Not one bit.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

A wife and a beautiful and smart daughter. (if I tell you I fix something in a second and nothing happens till tomorrow, the daughter won, you lost)

**What other hobbies?**

One big hobby used to be photography, but it takes up so much time now, it no longer oculd be considered a hobby.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

A Suburban I drive, a Chevelle ~'71 would be nice to have, you could still work on those cars, and after putting in some good ignition and other gadgets it would be just super sweet to ride.
