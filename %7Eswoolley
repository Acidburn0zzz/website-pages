**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I was probably sixteen or so, I presume? I installed an early redhat and I didn't know any commands, so I put Windows back on it. I installed SuSE linux after that and found it much easier to work with at least to learn the command line stuff, as I could bootstrap my way into the help docs. After mingling with the BSDs and other flavors of linux, I settled on Source Mage GNU/Linux.

I was fed up with Microsoft's Tax, and my dad was a Redmond, WA teacher. All these idiotic, spoiled Microsoft children... Well, you know, and the fact that I'd seen them give away all their software to schools in the area to get them hooked to it -- and it went down all the time.

When I went to a Liberal Arts University, I'd seen real unix-like systems in operation, and learned how truly inferior Microsoft Software was as I was a lab assistant for a number of years in an all-windows lab.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I've been using it as my primary OS since January, 2002. Still on my first install of "sorcerer" and never went back. (Edit: My first install was stolen from my work place -- a laptop and meth addicts looking for quick cash)

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

Source-based, and the magician nomenclature.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

World Dominance.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Well, I started at seven with Applesoft BASIC on an Apple IIGS, then I played around with HyperCard (a truly user-friendly language), then I moved to Visual Basic 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 -- Visual Basic was so incredibly slow when I learned Java (required at University), I was amazed at the difference in speed. I picked up Perl, sh/bash skills. Now I do most all of my programming in Perl or bash. Now I do a lot of tcl coding at my current workplace.

When I went to the University, I took two and a half years of all their computer science classes, then quit the University to do contract consulting for myself. A big project I did was with a Nuts and Bolts Company, then I did some work in medical and became an administrator at a Medical Clinic. After that, I started working at panasas working on the QA test harness.

I'm young, have a lot to learn (The Universe is an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our job in every generation is to reclaim a little more land. - T. H. Huxley) and despise concentrations of power.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

stay away from devel if at all possible. (Edit: And the stable ISOs).

Well, not quite true anymore now that we phased out devel and the stable isos are actually stable.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Not much more than playing around or something specialized for a client.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vi

**KDE or GNOME?**

gnome (edit: xfce4.2 now) (edit: I always end up going back to blackbox)

**BSD or GPL?**

gpl

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Two brothers and a sister.

http://tautology.org is one brother

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

1991 Honda Accord Wagon, probably an acura wagon if they made one.
Technically, my wife drives the car as I use my bike or get a ride with her.

My wife totalled that, so now I have her parents' '99 subaru legacy.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**
