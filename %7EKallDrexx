**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

In programming class my friend would wlaways talk about how much better linux was than windows, and I would always think to myself "dude shutup." Then later that year my friend said I should try it out. This was two years ago, and I started with rh7.3. Wasn't bad but the transition was slow as I was mostly in windows. Then I bought a new motherboard which had ethernet and thus redhat wasn't detecting it. I was determined to get it working, I spent literally 3 months talking to people and constantly recompiling the kernel, never having it work tho. Finally I switched to mandrake where at least my ethernet was detected. I talked to people, went through the pains of trying to recompile the kenrel and I learned a lot about linux in the process. Finally I started seeing why my kernels weren't working, and since I spent so much time in linux I was just stayed in linux. At that point I went from about half and half usage of windows/linux, then to 90% linux (windows only for games) and a few months ago I converted my desktop to pure linux!

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I just recently started using SMGL in the past 3 weeks (started around 1/10/03). Debian got on my nerves finally and so I tried out Sorcerer. I enjoyed it and almost used that untill a friend told me about SMGL. I instlaled it on my laptop, fell in love and I switched not looking back :-)

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I like the idea of source based distros except that gentoo really didn't like me it seemed. Finally Debian annoyed me and so I sought out a new distro on distrowatch.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I can definitely see SMGL prosper and become a great distro for people to use. I don't see it being good for linux newbies however but I don't think that should be a goal at all for SMGL (tho we shouldn't aim for just linux gurus).

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Education: About to get out of high school, 4 more months till I go off to college, and oh I can't wait. I'm going to get a computer science major.

Career: none yet, I work a stupid high school/college job at Atlanta Bread Company... wow lots of fun there :-P

Skills: In my free time I do a lot of programming, tho not much to put on a resume. I am working with a 3d engine I have a licence to as well as a Zaurus PDA and of course SMGL documentation.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Have fun!

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

None that have been really released publicly

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

I used to use purely vim untill SMGL, where the vim is quite annoying to deal with for various reasons so now I use emacs

**KDE or GNOME?**

none, too bloated, Fluxbox baby!!!

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Dog, bro, Mom, dad.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I drive a 1990 Honda Accord. Still runs. I don't know what my dream car is, I just need something to get me to point A and point B without problems (yes I know, I'm no fun ;-))
