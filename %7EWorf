== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

My first contact with Linux was earlier, but approx 1998 I installed it on my own box and started to use it. Mainly because OS/2 started to disappoint me. And I always felt that there must be something else than the OS that everybody uses and complains about.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Exactly as long as it exists. Well -- not exactly, but 3 days longer -- just before Kyle [...snip...] and SMGL forked.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I already compiled my own kernels and kde and other stuff when using SuSE, tried LFS but decided it was too much work, and searched a source based distribution. I tried to pick the one which fits me best, and here I am now.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

With CPU's and Internet connections getting faster and faster there will be more and more people trying stuff like SMGL. So as long as no "Dolt" changes all bash scripts to perl we have a bright future!

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I study Technical Physics

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Don't watch the compile output! \\ That doesn't mean that you should leave big jobs completely unattended, but watching them will drive you crazy.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Well -- I had some small jobs where I coded in a expensive and immature half 16 - half 32 bit environment in a strange modification of a long dead language called "Basic". \\ But I guess no one knows that anymore.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

no thanks...

**KDE or GNOME?**

KDE, but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't use apps like gimp

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

I think I have parents and brothers and sisters in real live.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I drive VW Passat, Beetle, Audi A4, Audi A6, ... or whatever company car my dad let's me drive with :-)

Ok -- seriously -- I don't own a car, because most of the time I'm faster by bike, and in the rare occasions a car would be handy I can borrow one.

If I once need a car, it must be big enough to transport 4 people with all thir toys -- err -- computer equipment.
