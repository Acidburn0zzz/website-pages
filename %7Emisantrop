**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

It was about 2002 when I first installed Redhat. I was interested in Linux because everyone talked about it and so I wanted to test it too. First it wasn't easy because of the big difference to Windows so i removed it and reinstalled Windows. But after a half year I gave it a second try and since then I'm using it. I tested nearly all distributions and also *BSD. I was excited of the FreeBSD ports but I had problems with some drivers so I went back to Linux. Tested all source-distros listed on distrowatch, SMGL was the best for me.

**vi or emacs?**

My first editor was emacs but I like nano the most.

**KDE or GNOME?**

I was using KDE a long time but since I saw some fluxbox screenies it is the one and only for me :-) \\ Having the choice between them I would choose to GNOME.

**Favourite IRC-client**

irssi, because it's smart and you don't need X.

**Things that you don't want to miss in your life**

My computer, coffee and junkfood. Also good music is needed everytime ;-)
