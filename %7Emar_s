**IRC nick(s):** mar_s

**Location/Country:** Germany. Mostly in the vicinity of Lake Constance

== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

My first contact with Linux was around '97. A friend of mine told me that there was something called Linux that might interest me. And I was interested.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

A rough guess is since 2004 or 2005. I don't have the old log files any more.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I found it frustrating to guess which devel-packages the binary distros needed in order to compile something from source. So I took a short peek at Linux from Scratch, thinking: Why can't one write a script to do this? Then I tried Sorcerer Linux, mostly because I liked the magical theme. But their server was not available when I wanted to get an up to date iso for reinstall, so I downloaded Source Mage instead.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

SMGL will always have a special place in the heart of those people who want to have the last word on what their computer does for them. That's because it is a tool they use to make it work.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I've dedicated myself to professional playing and spending a few thoughts on why it works and how to trick it. In other words: I'm studying physics.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Have fun with it, if it's on your own computer.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I've never worked on other software in the sense of being in the development process. I've just used it to get my work done.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vim. I make myself believe that the visual mode helps me sometimes.

**KDE or GNOME?**

I never run programs beginning with 'k', but sometimes with 'g' at the beginning. But openbox is the only one who may manage my desktop.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

No. That is, I'm living away from my parents and my sister in order to study.

**What other hobbies?**

I'm going climbing when I find some rocks, or I switch to a kajak when I think it's necessary. Does "not hearing the faint doorbell while listening to music on the headphones" count as a hobby?

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I'm still driving on of those lightweight cars with two pedals and two wheels. My dream car would be the one that automagically creates free parking spaces ;=)

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

I would be more than happy to show a picture of myself, if only my digicam didn't have these three pixel errors.
