**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started using Linux (Debian) and BSD (NetBSD) on my Atari TT sometime in early 1993. I started playing with various distributions on Intel machines back in 1996 when the University I worked for (University of Maine, Orono) sold me a couple of complete systems for $25.00 US. I've ended up experimenting with probably 20 distributions -- some for personal use, others just to familiarize myself with them to go with my Linux advocacy, so I could help friends when they encountered problems.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I've been using SMGL since about April of 2002. I was introduced to SGL from a cover disk on a Linux Format magazine issue and liked it. Further investigation raised some red flags for me, so I decided to switch to SMGL soon after.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I liked the activity on http://forums.sourcemage.org and being the superficial type of person that I am, I liked the color scheme/raven -- once I saw the [[404.png|404 page]] I was hooked.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

"Ask again later" (stupid 8-ball)

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Dropped out of high school after 3 months. Managed to live in or stay in all fifty US states, and on all seven continents, what with hitchhiking and spending time in the USCG. \\ Career: Retired \\ Skills: Advanced typos \\ Goals: Confusing as many people as humanly possible.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Who are you, and why do you keep pestering my bots?

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Published a lot of shareware software for the Atari series computers, other than that, all my programming has been for my own use.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vi(m) -- but emacs on my Ataris

**KDE or GNOME?**

Base libraries for both, but I prefer simple window managers.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

My wife Karen, our husky/malamute Alinak, and our malamute/samoyed/wolf Boomer -- the boys are gone now, but I'm not taking the photo down.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I'd like to have my Alfa Romeo Montreal back.  We own a Mercury Mystique and a Yamaha Zuma.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**
