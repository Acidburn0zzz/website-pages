**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Oooh, that's about 1995, my harddisk with windows fell to ground and I suddenly lost all of my work, so I had to start from scratch anyway. I thought that linux will be interesting break before I install windows again :-)

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Well, be afraid of me :-)
