**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I first used linux back in 1997/98, it happened after I read an article about RedHat Linux in a magazine. A few weeks after reading it I found a 6CD set that included RedHat 5.2, Slackware (Can't remember what version), Turbolinux 2.1 (I think) and a few other CDs with programs and source on them. At the time I really didn't have a good understanding of computers, sure I got past partitioning the hard drive, but not before removing my (fathers) windows install (several times). Oh the 'fun' that was.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Simply put, I have not used it yet. I have had it installed sure, but to download anything useful would max out my bband download limit.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I was looking for a decent new Linux distro that was small so that I could download it withing a week. I came to the website, noticed it was not a very amazing design so I decided to talk to the people in their IRC channel.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Well first off you might have noticed I'm a little young. Second I hope it doesn't bother you that I have left school. Those two things aside I'm just your normal geek, got my certificate 1 in IT from the institute of TAFE, working on certificate 2, then on to 3, 4. My skills are mostly self taught, I am a capable web designer and php coder. I have many other skills but I don't want to get into that.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Operating Systems: MS-DOS 4-6, Windows 3.1-2000, many linux distros, OS/2 Warp, Mac OS 6-9 and X.

Programming Languages: I know PHP, VisualBasic and Quick Basic. I was looking into C# but I don't really need those skills. I also know plenty of JavaScript, and VB Script.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Neither, I'm not a fan of console editors, I like to use PHPEdit for my php, html and css work.

**KDE or GNOME?**

Now days I stick to Gnome, it's a very easy system to use.

**BSD or GPL?**

I have only used GPL, so I would have to go with that.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Yes, just the standard crew plus one: mother, sister, father, step mother.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Don't drive (and where would I drive to?) but I really would love a decent Peugeot!

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

I Would if I had a scanner or digital camera.
