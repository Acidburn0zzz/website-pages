**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Sometime around 1998 a friend installed SuSE 6.2 on our family PC. I got tired of tweaking windows and so I started with a new OS. I must be one of the last people who "grew up on DOS", so the console was not that unusual.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I started in early 2003, when I got fed up with SuSE (and especially SuSEconfig)

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

When I decided it would be time to reinstall my system (Win98 started getting unstable and SuSE 8.1 was getting on my nerves), I asked around if anybody of my friends knew a good linux distribution that was not based on "Always assume your average user has the IQ of a potato". After I decided Debian would //not// do it (who wants software that is per definition more than one year old?), a friend pointed me into the direction of the source-based distributions. And as he used Source Mage, I started with it as well.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

The way things are going, I think we might become a user-oriented, probably even for-sale distribution. Not the way I would want it to go, but it seems I am rather isolated on that point. So I'll just go along until SMGL is old enough to walk on its own. Until then, count me in as a loyal developer, although I don't have too much computing time and resources right now.

I would personally rather like the "if you find a bug, fix it;if you want a feature, write it" approach.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

* Education -- I am currently in the German "Gymnasium", which means something like High School. I plan to study Mathematics or Computer studies (or something in between).
* Career -- Student. I have no real plans on what I want to work on, probably programmer
* Skills -- I am very good at mathematics, and have some experience at programming algorithms for all kinds of purposes.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Have fun, and if you need any software which is not in the grimoire, please write a spell for it and submit it. Then we all profit from it.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

tweaking my windows...

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

**KDE or GNOME?**

Who needs X? \\ Answer: Mozilla, xchat \\ Now using ion

**BSD or GPL?**

**Do you have any family?**

Mother, father (living in the Netherlands), brother (off studying), sister (ditto), 2 cats ;-)

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I can't drive any car with 17 in Germany, and I don't dream about cars.
