The Codex is the collection of [[Grimoire|grimoires]] used in Source Mage. \\ You can view the latest Codex at http://codex.sourcemage.org.

== Managing grimoires ==

All of the [[Grimoire|official grimoires]] can be added or removed by using the {{{"scribe"}}} command, which defaults to prepending to the newly added grimoire in index.

For example, to add the [[Grimoire/test|test]] and [[Grimoire/games|games]] grimoires and remove the [[Grimoire/stable|stable]] grimoire, you would do the following:

{{{
# scribe add games
# scribe add test
# scribe remove stable
}}}

That would then give you a codex index (view with {{{"scribe index"}}}) like this:

{{{
Codex Listing
-------------

 [0] : test : /var/lib/sorcery/codex/test
 [1] : games : /var/lib/sorcery/codex/games
}}}

The main Source Mage grimoires are also available via rsync by running a command like:

{{{
scribe add games from rsync://sourcemage.org::codex/games
}}}

Grimoire tarballs are generated and published on http://codex.sourcemage.org every 6 hours: \\ at 0, 6, 12 and 18 hours EST ([[http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone|EST]] Eastern Standard Time = [[http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time|UTC]] Coordinated Universal Time - 5h).
