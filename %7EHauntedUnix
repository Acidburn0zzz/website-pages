== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I began using Linux in around 2001, I'm never quite sure why, I'm just glad I did :-)

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

In around January 2005, bascule told me of this amazing distro where you can restore your whole set of packages with a simple command, as I was prone to breaking boxes at the time, it intrigued (sp) me. Now, you're all stuck with me ;-)

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

The ability to restore your system, the wonderful community, and sorcery. I happen to like sorcery, despite some of the other devs thinking it's 'orrid ;-)

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I see a well planned, slow return to popularity, whilst avoiding the rush of lamer/ricers which has hindered Gentoo.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Stick at it, and don't be afraid to ask for help ;-)

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I worked on Chron X, for Genetic Anomalies.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vi(m). Emacs is an okay OS, it just lacks a decent editor

**KDE or GNOME?**

Enlightenment or XFCE4

**BSD or GPL?**

I'd only use GPL for my own code, but BSD doesn't bother me that much. If a developer wishes for their work to be reused anyway, so be it.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Yes.
