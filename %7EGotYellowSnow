== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

In 1996 or 1997, because I had had it with windows 95 crashing on me, and because I had been told that Linux was great for development.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

As long as there's been a SMGL. I was using Sorcery for a few months before the fork.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I was tired of fighting Redhat's dependencies, and therefore had compiled so much of my own stuff it wasn't really a Redhat box anymore. I was going to try to build my own using the Linux from scratch method, when I came across sorcery. It was like cooking linux from scratch using kitchenaid and blender and microwave to help with the boring work.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

Besides sucking up lots of my time? Being the best way to easily roll your own linux distro and keep it up to date...

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Going the slow route for my CS BS, currently taking some courses at University of Maryland, planning on finishing up at VCU next year. I have only had one computer related job so far, working at AT&T with their Worldnet development staff, was sysadmin/facilities for some of the development and testing machines.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Don't eat the yellow snow ;-)

Buy a house as soon as you can, buy less then the realtor tells you you can afford, that way you start building up equity istead of paying rent and don't end up spending too much in intrest versus a larger house...

Mountain biking is fun...  Get off your duff once and a while..

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I was lightly involved with the tuxnes project

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vim or jed in emacs mode. emacs is just too freaking big. Sometimes use jedit or jbuilder when coding in java.

**KDE or GNOME?**

IceWM

**BSD or GPL?**

LGPL. It seems to be a good compromise between the two. GPL is useful. BSD is for when you feel really generous.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

A wife who's an artist.. Keeps my life full of beauty.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I have a 1990 Toyota Corolla that runs like a dream even though it has 230,000 miles on it.. One day it'll just up and die totally I suppose, but so far no problems ;-) Also drive a 1993 Eagle Summit. It's a piece of crap, but it's small and light and manual trans, so it's fun to drive. ;-) My dream car is a Mazda Miata, red or black, convertable.

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

Maybe later ;-)
