**IRC nick(s):** Belxjander / Beljander

**Role in SMGL:** General Elementalist ( Grimoire / Cauldron / Security[my focus] / ...)

**Age/Birthdate:** 30

== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I never liked Windows to begin with so I choose to use other operating systems where available.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I have stayed with SMGL ever since I burned my first Rescue disc [ about 20020116 or some such ].

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I first heard about it from someone on IRC before the name change from "Sorcerer" to "Source Mage".

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I like it but I don't think "long term" about such things normally,

[+5Y]: I am thinking the future is with the users who give us direction and the growth of the distribution

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

[5years late]: my education is mostly self-taught around computer engineering, from some basic electronics upto system building to a purpose through networking and fundamental programming, I have also taught myself to be able to program with any given language after being given a 1 page summary to read in 1 or 2 hours and use of a function reference to write a complete program, I have done this as a challenge with a friend one time and produced a complete program in under 4 hours with a new programming language I learned to use at the same time.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

there are more people using Source Mage? like, wow, hello... hope you don't mind a paranioa freak handling the security :-) [+5Y]

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I also develop for the Amiga OS when my A4000 workstation is at hand to do so.

[+5Y]: the Amiga situation has meant I now no longer have any Amiga workstations and spend the majority of my time focused on Linux and Source Mage specifically

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

neither really, jed

**KDE or GNOME?**

these are different and who doesn't install them both?

**BSD or GPL?**

I honestly don't have an opinion about this at this time.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

yes, and keep my siblings and parents away from me :-)

[+5Y]: I have also met the love of my life and will be starting a family once I sort out a stable job situation

[+6Y]: Now married and starting that family,  Im *making* my own work instead of finding work :-)

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I don't have a car... I don't care for such things :-) [+5Y]: I am still more focused and feel to walk or use a bicycle instead of a car.

I've just never felt any need to have or own a car
