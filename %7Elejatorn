**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started with Debian during fall 2002.

It had been quite some time I wanted to give it a try because I was really wondering how would another OS than windows be. So far I never had the motivation to do it since I was mostly using my computer to play games but my uncle (who had already worked a long time with Linux) managed to convince me, pointing out that it would help me later on in college.

So, there I had one of my friends burnt the Debian iso's and I dived for the first time. The first steps were quite terrible and it has really been a pain to get it to run, especially X. I slowly learnt how to use it but each time I had a problem it took me a lot of time to figure out why and to fix it. It was most of it due to the fact I was a rookie but also because I didn't find the way things were done in Debian intuitive.

That's why, back in Sweden in December 2003, during long winter nights I started looking for a new distro to try out. I had heard about source-based distros and I wanted to give it a try. I found out about Lunar-linux first and was naturally drawn to it because of my Astrophysics passion, but at that time (dunno about now), their installer kinda sucked and I never managed to install it properly. So from there (since Lunar and Source Mage are fork brothers) it was easy to find out about Source Mage and there I was :-)

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since January 2004.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

Source based, fantasy vocabulary.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I hope we will keep getting new devs regularly so that we can get some more work done on the grimoires. I'm pretty confident Sorcery will keep improving as it is already an awesome tool and and it regularly attracts new devs to help Andrew with it.

I'd like it to become a more popular distro but I wouldn't want it to become some kind of hype like Gentoo has become. I like the nice community of people we have right now.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Got an Astrophysics master's degree in 2005 and a CS master's degree in 2006. I'm currently working as an IT engineer for CNRS (french national scientific research center) in the [[http://www.eu-degree.eu|Degree]] project. I'd like either to work in science, something like being a coder in a lab, or to work in open-source coding. I'm also thinking about going abroad in third world countries to help out a bit, like teaching physics in Africa or in South-America.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

I love you guys! ;-)

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I worked on the civbot project, some master/worker thingie to do some distributed scientific computing but I ran out of time to finish it, I hope I can work on it again someday (look in sourceforge if you're interested). As for the OSes, I tried a bit of FreeBSD, I used various unixes at school and at work and I finally got the time to install a plan9 cpu server at home!

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Definitely vi(m).

**KDE or GNOME?**

None of them, I don't fancy bloated desktops. My wm of the moment is wmii, it's really great. \\ However, I don't deny KDE is great when you just want to install Linux to one of your friends or show it around a bit. Though I prefer the gtk2 looks than the Qt one.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

1 younger brother and 1 younger sister.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I don't give a smeg about cars. To me it's just a means of transportation, and not one of the best I must say. I much prefer going by bike or by tram. \\ Anyway, I have a stupid Peugeot 106 with a flat tire...
