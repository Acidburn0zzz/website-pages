== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

The first time I started using Linux was with a SuSe 5.3 around 1998, because I heard so much propaganda about it and wanted to see wheter this was true or not, but was pretty disappointed in its desktop use, and finally switched completly to Linux in early 2002, when Source Mage had everything I was looking for in a distribution.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since somewhere in 2002 on my main pc, and shortly after this the ide controller on my win95 *yeah* pc burned out I installed there a SMGL too.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I loved the source-based idea, which allows high flexibility. And of course it seemed much more userfriendly than gentoo when I compared :-)

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

Great hacking value, but not usuable for business ( heh, time is money,.. yeah xfree is compiled soon... )

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I currently pretend to study and work in the meantime for a german Linux company. I played around with asm and vb in the windows world and currently try to get a grip at c, gtk and linux programming

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

If you are pregnant, think about Eric as a name :-)

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

A trojanscanner for windows, some virus related stuff, and everything which seems to have hacking value to me, currently I try to do some modules for a silc bot.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vi, of course... When I am forced to use anything else, I got :i's all over the document :-)

**KDE or GNOME?**

gnome, I don't really like oop

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

A sister, two parents, but no family like marriage or children ( even if my gf wants to... )

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

CAR? Thats 2 tires too much, I prefer a motorcycle ( harley ), but still missing the money =)

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

On all recent photographs I got, I am too drunk to f..k, so no photo :-)
