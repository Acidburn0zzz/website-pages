== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started around 2002 with Red Hat 7.3, trying to find a different ambient than Windows ME which was the only thing I had access to at the time, but more for self-knowledge than anything. I've been everywhere from Red Hat, Mandrake, Debian, Slackware, Gentoo, FreeBSD and now Source Mage.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I started using Source Mage about mid-2006, just to try something different, and I liked what I saw and how it worked. Sure, it needs some work, but that's what we're here for.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

Namely, that I can choose what I want, where I want and when I want without the system constricting me. And add to that the ease of sorcery.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

Better adoption of Source Mage amongst the Linux community. We're a great bunch.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I mostly just completed High School for now, working on getting a few certifications and such at the moment, mostly on computer repairs, network management/maintenance and getting a Zend certification for my PHP addictions.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

If it doesn't work at first, work with it, modify it, and hack it until it does what you want. Functionality is gained with patience and sacrifice.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

FreeBSD, Linux, Windows (Win95 to present)

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

nano, but I can handle vim.

**KDE or GNOME?**

I have found my enlightenment //(no pun intended)// in XFCE

**BSD or GPL?**

I prefer BSD license since it's not viral like the GPL, but I can work with and by the rules of the GPL.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Live with my mother, have two older siblings. And of course the usual family tree.

**What other hobbies?**

PHP, Anime and IRC.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Don't even own one, but when I do, I want the 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer. I hate Humvees.
