== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

Uhh.. sometime in 1998.. because I was tired of Windows and disliked Microsofts monopoly!

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since October 2001, thats when it was still called Sorcerer GNU/Linux and run by Kyle Sallee.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

A message posted to the Trustix list tsl-discuss that mentioned it. The name caught my attention and the rest is history ;-)

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

Hopefully we shall rise to become as good or even better than Gentoo (not technically, IMHO we are already there, but we lack support, stability and users).

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Education.. hmm.. Selftaught and aiming to go to University. \\ Career, well.. some day perhaps a Sysadmin or Systems Programmer or something along those lines.. \\ Skills.. well, I usually have quite an easy time figuring out new stuff and can usually come up with some very nice solutions for problems quite fast..

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Use the Source Duke.. ehm.. Actually I'd like to thank all the supporters we DO have and encourage people to do what they can to help us grow.. all SMGL users will be spared when we conquer the planet.. ehm... just forget that part.. for now!

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Well.. not really much that has seen publication..

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vi -- no particular reason, just never sat down to learn emacs and must admit that it is somewhat intimidating to have a texteditor that can also brew coffee while playing a game of chess ;-)

**KDE or GNOME?**

KDE -- haven't tried Gnome 2.0 yet, but so far KDE has kicked Gnome's ass all over the place :-)

**BSD or GPL?**

No real preference even though I usually go for GPL -- I am more into ESR than RMS :-)

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

A mother, sister and some grandparents. No girlfriend or kids :-)

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Car? How should I be able to afford a car with the kind of pay I get?

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**

Just take a look at my homepage.. it's there.. even though I look like a prisoner..
