=Our History=

In the beginning there was Sorcerer GNU/Linux, a GNU/Linux distro created by Kyle Sallee that used a unique GPLed package management system named Sorcery. And it was good.

Unfortunately, due to several issues, Sorcerer was forked into Lunar Penguin (now [[http://www.lunar-linux.org|Lunar Linux]]), and Kyle took the original Sorcerer offline with no explanation. Thanks to the freedom granted by the GPL, we continued the Sorcerer distro from assembled backups, etc.

A month later, as Sorcerer was starting to regain lost ground, Kyle relaunched his version of [[http://sorcerer.silverice.org|Sorcerer]] under a non-forking (thus non-free) license he calls the [[SPL]] and dropped the term //"GNU/Linux"//. We renamed our distro to Source Mage after a vote, out of respect for Kyle's wishes.

Development now continues on 3 seperate distros with three distinct goals.
* Lunar-Linux aims to produce a stable, solid, source-based distro using well tested software versions.
* Sorcerer's aims are unclear at this time, but apparently will create a non-free source-based Linux distro to suit Kyle's vision.
* Source Mage is working to continue rapid development of the sorcery tools and create a 100% free source-based GNU/Linux distro that allows users the maximum amount of freedom and choice possible.

We hope you will take the time to evaluate each of the sorcery based solutions and find the one that best suits your interests. And we also hope that Source Mage is your choice.
