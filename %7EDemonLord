**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I began using Linux in October 1998, as a mean to share my internet connection to different PCs. I used Debian 2.0 (hamm) back then, installed from floppies on an old 386. I immediately fell in love with it, and installed it on my main PC nearly immediately after. I stuck to Debian until Mandrake 7.0, then followed Mandrake updates up to 8.2. By this time, I was teacher assistant since January 2001, giving networking classes using Linux, so I picked up a few tricks of my own and did a lot of troubleshooting.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I've first installed SMGL when I got my laptop. According to my activity log, it was exactly on July 17th 2002.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I've read about Sorcerer on Slashdot.org, and downloaded the ISO. By the time I got my PC, Sorcerer was gone, so I looked for what happened to the project. Source Mage was the logical follow up, so I jumped on the SMGL bandwagon. Unlike many, I haven't even heard of Gentoo until much later. Gave it a try on a friend's SUN workstation (SMGL hadn't been ported to the architecture yet), and I disliked it, confirming my choice to stick with SMGL.

What struck me at first was how easy it is to port new software to the distribution. A simple [[Spell/Files/DETAILS|DETAILS]] file with a bunch of "equals" and that's about it.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

It'll grow as the most popular niche distribution thus creating a paradox. People will come to it for its simplicity and control, and it'll remain in the hands of people, creating strong community feelings. I wouldn't be surprised if it became the favorite distribution of Linus Torvalds himself ;-P
