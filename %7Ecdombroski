**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I first started using Linux sometime around 1996. I installed Debian on my family's computer but really couldn't figure out what to do with it after that. I had been using a computer at home for a year or two at the time and I had heard a lot about Linux so I figured I'd give it a try. I figured out a few things but I don't think I had the patience then to really sit down and figure out what was going on.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I'd heard about Sorcery/Source Mage (I believe it was still Sorcery at the time) in a article on slashdot in 2001. I kept it in the back of my head as something to try someday, until my friend David Kowis said he was going to install linux on a computer of his and I showed Source Mage to him (the split had occured at this point). It was at this point that I really got into using linux. Right now I use Source Mage on 2 servers, a laptop and my firewall and Win XP on my desktop so I can play games like Thief: Deadly Shadows.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

As I said above, I saw it in an article on Slashdot and went to the web site. It looked like it might be really cool and not too hard to actually do. I really like it because you can decide exactly what is going to be on your system. Although it can be a pain when people assume you have various things when writing documentation for something.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

Hopefully a full and complete antivirus section :-)

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Education: I'm a senior in college, working towards a BS/CS degree. I've got most of my CS classes done, now I just need the <well-rounded student classes>.

Career: Computer programmer for the US Air Force. Currently writing a database in Access<shudder>, but usually doing other odds and ends instead.

Skills: I like to think I have some skill at playing computer games. But not ever getting around to actually finishing a game doesn't speak well for that. I like to tinker with my systems and learn about new programs and new functionality for programs I already use to make my systems better.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Your using a distro that causes you to actually learn something about how your system works. Not to say we're 133t or something, but it takes a person more willing to learn and more willing to work through difficulties to use Source Mage than to use a distro like RedHat or Mandrake.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I haven't really developed anything outside of my job.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vi. It's what I learned first and is powerful enough for what I do.

**KDE or GNOME?**

CLI atm, eventually e17

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

I have a wife of 4 years (Dec 7 2001) and a daughter of 17 months (14 July 2004).

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

A black 2003 Dodge Neon with standard transmission. I'd like to have a Camaro, however last I checked they discontinued it.
