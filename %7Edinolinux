== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started using Linux around 2003 because I wanted to try something new. My first distro was RedHat 9 which I used for almost a year. Then I got an internet connection and a cd burner, and started to download lots of distros.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

It's really been back and forth, I first tried smgl in 2005, but didn't use it much. I've been using smgl as my primary distro since June 2006.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I liked that it was up to date and fast. I also liked sorcery because it's easy to use. And the support is just great :-)

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

Best source distro in the world ;-)

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I will be finishing middle school soon and then, I don't know, probably something computer related.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Keep using smgl, you will get it running!

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I've been doing lots of stuff. Before I started using smgl as my primary distro, I worked on making an improved version of Solaris.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

Both, I used emacs a lot, but then I tried vi and found it quite ok.

**KDE or GNOME?**

KDE. Tried GNOME a few times, but never liked it.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Yes

**What other hobbies?**

Not many. I like airplanes, but that's about it.

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Not into cars, so I can't really answer ;-)
