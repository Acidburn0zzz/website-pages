=Developer Organization=

Source Mage GNU/Linux contributors are organized into a team of **Lead Developers** and a team of **General Developers**. Leads are further divided into a **Project Lead**, identified **Component Leads**, and **General Leads**. The **Project and Component Leads** may also have **Assistants**.

==General Developers==

* Can be added to the project and given repository access by any **Lead Developer**
* Have commit access to the various project components, at the discretion of the Lead over that component
* Have the option to cast a binding vote in all **Lead Election** votes
* Have the option to cast a non-binding vote in all other votes
* Can be removed by a super majority vote of the **Lead Developers**
* Can have a removal vote vetoed by a super majority vote of all **Developers**
* Are automatically nominated and seconded for a removal vote after one year of inactivity (defined as no committed changes to any part of the project's source code or documentation repositories (including web sites) and/or no logged changes to any project servers)
* Once someone is no longer considered a developer, their entry on the [[Developers]] page, all of their SCM accounts, @sourcemage.org mail aliases, sourcemage IRC cloak, and special #sourcemage IRC permissions (including permissions on other IRC channels related to the Project) must be removed
