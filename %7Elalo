**IRC nick(s):** lalo

**Role in SMGL:** general guru (mostly grimoire)

**Age/Birthdate:** 31 as of this writing

**Location/Country:** Beijing, China

== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

In 95, when commercial internet opened up in Brazil. I always believed software was supposed to be shared, so it was quite refreshing to discover there was a whole community of people who believed the same, and with a complete OS too!

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Since about April 2006.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I have been a Gentoo user previously, and I'm convinced source-based distros are the way to go; but first and foremost, I need my system to be easily and sanely hackable, and SMGL gives me that better than any I've seen. Though honestly, I installed it experimentally; what's probably the real reason I stuck to it was the really warm community we have on IRC, which helped me trough my initiation pains.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I don't really think about it. The only thing I know about the future of SMGL is that I'll be using it for a long time.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

I spent about half my profesisonal life as a Zope programmer, during which time I was a core contributor to [[http://www.plone.org/|Plone]]. My "favourite project that failed" was [[http://picogui.org/|PicoGUI]]. Last year I spent significant time on [[http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/|Bazaar-NG]]. These days I contribute to [[http://crossfire.real-time.com/|Crossfire]] and [[http://interreality.org|VOS]].

**vi or emacs?**

Emacs. Even with a profound hate of lisp, I find it incredibly useful that my editor is actually a bunch of widgets controlled by an interpreter; I love that I can M-x and issue commands that influence anything that's going on there. Yeah, it's bloated; but I can live with that, if that's the price for having tramp, dvc, python-mode, rst-mode, flyspell, and so on and so forth.

**KDE or GNOME?**

I don't like the way KDE looks and feels; it's like Windows with some minimal polish, feels "klunky" to me. But I don't like how GNOME has to keep one or two dozen daemons in memory, bloating me out of my mind, and the hiding of options "I know how to run your computer better than you do". For the moment I'm happy with XFCE, except using Beryl (nee Compiz) rather than xfwm.

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL. Proprietary software is unethical, and copyrights as a whole need to be reformed or abolished.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

(later)

**What other hobbies?**

Sci-fi (reading, watching, writing), and role-playing games (the dice and talking king, or live action, not on the computer)

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I'm not a car person. My dream car is a Chrysler wagon I've been seeing for years, but that's mostly an irrational passion. I'm more likely to get a motorcycle, when I bother. Or in the long term, a [[http://www.moller.com/|SkyCar]].

**Please attach a recent photograph of yourself -- if you're brave enough ;=)**
