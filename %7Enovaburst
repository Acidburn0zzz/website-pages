== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started using Linux around RedHat 5.2, which I believe was around 1998. A friend of mine was talking about it and so I decided to try it. I have always enjoyed messing around with different operating systems.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I have been using Source Mage for about 2.5 years now. I started back in January of 2004.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

I was looking for a good source-based distro. I tried some of the other source-based distros out there, but the install for one was a ridiculous drawn out process and the others were not as organized or were missing things. SMGL had everything I was looking for. I really liked the installation too.

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

I see a bright future for SMGL. It is good enough to be right up at the top with the most popular distributions.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I have a degree in Electronics Technology from Indiana State University. \\ I'm a System Administrator/Programmer for a Congregation of Roman Catholic women.

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

My first computer was a Commodore 64. From there I went straight to Amiga's. I was co-owner of a popular Amiga Web Site called GetBoinged.org. I now have a blog called The AROS Show where I write about the AROS operating system. It is a x86 Amiga type operating system. \\ The Linux distributions I have used include Damn Small Linux, Mandrake, RedHat, Suse, Slackware, Slax and Ubuntu.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

I can use vi if I need to, but I have started using Emacs for my editing and programming. I am learning Common Lisp and Emacs is used as the main open source programming environment.

**KDE or GNOME?**

I used to be a GNOME fan, but that has changed. I now use KDE and Enlightenment 17 on two different machines. I may switch to Enlightenment altogether, but I haven't yet.

**BSD or GPL?**

It just depends.

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Wife and two kids

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

Ford F-150. Dream car would probably be a Porsche 928, like in the movie Risky Business. Another dream car would be a Hummer.
