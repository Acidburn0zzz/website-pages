== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

In 2001, I first needed Linux to do my homework, some C programming... Then, I kept Linux, but as a secondary OS. I definitively switched to Linux in the middle of 2003, with the Slackware 9.0. I find Linux more stable, far more flexible, cheaper, more free obviously, and it gives me a lot of fun.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

Well, after six months on Slackware, I began to feel frustrated with the binary packages. I compiled a lot of the packages by myself, but it was rather boring, even with checkinstall. So I thought that a source-based distribution was made for me. I only knew Gentoo and Source Mage, I tried first Source Mage because sorcery vocabulary sounds well to my ears :-) It was one year ago, and I still have to try Gentoo... Maybe one day ?

**What future do you personally see for SMGL?**

1.0 ISO released first and then we will see... :-)

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

Well, I'm currently working on PhD Thesis here in Calais in the area of computer graphics. I'm working on flame models. I'm also a teacher for a living. I teach Linux OS, system programming, C language and computer graphics.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Cast spells everyday and you will feel better... If you love this distro and that you would like to help, join us ! There is always a way to help, even for non-programmers :-) \\ And be careful with april's fools !!!

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

No one, SMGL is my first free software experience. Besides this, I study computer graphics.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

emacs but I'm not annoyed with vi ;-)

**KDE or GNOME?**

Gnome now (but I used KDE for a while...)

**BSD or GPL?**

GPL definitively...

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

My wife, my two parents, and three sisters... They almost all use GNU/Linux (only two reticent sisters) thanks to me :-))

**What kind of car do you drive? Or what is your dream car?**

I drive an dozen years old VW GOLF 3, which my parents gave to me... Quite old, but a really reliable car :-). Sufficient for me... My dream car ?? Mmmh... A cheap electric and clean car !!!
