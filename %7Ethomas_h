== Common ==

**When did you first start using Linux and why?**

I started using Linux around 2003, with a Red Hat. I just wanted to learn more about computers, how they work. Linux being free was also a benefit. But shortly I found RedHat a bit limited when it comes to tweaking the system. That's when I happily discovered Source Mage. I also used Mandrake and Debian.

**How long have you been using the [[About|SMGL]] distribution?**

I've been using SMGL since August, 2003. This is my primary OS since this time.

**What piqued your interest in SMGL initially?**

Source-based, and the Sorcery metaphor

**Tell us a little bit about yourself. Education/Career/Skills?**

I'm a student in INT ("Institut National des Télécommunications"), near Paris, with my major being network and computer security.

**Any personal messages for the Source Mage users out there?**

Just try it !

**What other OS programs/software have you worked on?**

Various stuff for my personal use, from a popup killer under Windows to an image processing tool under Linux.

== Flamewars ==

**vi or emacs?**

vi(m)

**KDE or GNOME?**

Xfce

**BSD or GPL?**

It's hard to say: in a perfect world, where every people using code would give back to the community, BSD would be perfect. \\ But in the real world, the 'viral' effect of the GPL produces more or less the same result, but can scare...

== Strictly personal ==

**Do you have any family?**

Two younger brothers

Reading (SF, fantasy, novels, ...), watching animes, sometimes rollers skating, ...
